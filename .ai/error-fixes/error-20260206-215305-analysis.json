  "error_analysis": "The agent encountered a \"File not found\" error for \"issue_body.txt\". This file is crucial for the agent to parse the error log and proceed with its task. The error indicates that the necessary input for the agent's operation was not provided or was not accessible within its execution environment.",
  "root_cause": "The `issue_body.txt` file, which is expected to contain the detailed error log for analysis, was not present at the location where the agent attempted to read it. This is likely due to a misconfiguration in the pipeline that invokes the Error Recovery Agent, failing to correctly provision or path the issue body content as an input file.",
  "fix_strategy": "An automated code fix within the repository is not applicable here, as the problem lies with the agent's execution environment or input provisioning, not with the repository's code itself. The strategy is to flag this for human review to investigate the pipeline's configuration and ensure `issue_body.txt` is correctly generated and passed to the agent.",
