  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was invoked to analyze and fix a pipeline failure, but the crucial input, the error log, was reported as 'File not found: issue_body.txt'. This means the agent could not access the details of the original error, preventing any further analysis or automated fix attempts.",
  "root_cause": "The primary input required for the Error Recovery Agent to function, which is the error log detailing the pipeline failure, was missing or inaccessible. The system attempted to read a file named 'issue_body.txt' (presumably containing the error log from the GitHub issue body) but failed because the file was not found at the expected location.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the error is with the input provided to the Error Recovery Agent itself, no automated code changes can be made to the repository. The strategy is to clearly communicate that the error log is missing, explain why an automatic fix is impossible under these circumstances, and request human intervention to provide the correct error log or manually resolve the issue.",
