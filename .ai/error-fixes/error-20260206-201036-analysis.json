  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent encountered a critical error: it failed to locate the error log file `issue_body.txt` at the expected path `/home/runner/work/AID/AID/issue_body.txt`. This prevents the agent from performing any analysis or generating a fix for the original pipeline error, as the primary input (the error log) is missing.",
  "root_cause": "The agent's execution environment or invocation mechanism did not provide the `issue_body.txt` file containing the error log. This indicates a misconfiguration in how the error log is passed to the agent, or a failure in a preceding step that was supposed to generate this file in the specified location.",
  "fix_strategy": "Automatic code fix for the target repository is not possible, as the agent cannot access the original error log. The immediate fix requires human intervention to address the agent's input pipeline. This involves ensuring that the `issue_body.txt` file, containing the actual error log for `error-20260206-201036`, is correctly generated and placed in the expected location (`/home/runner/work/AID/AID/issue_body.txt`) before the agent is invoked. Alternatively, the agent's invocation mechanism needs to be reviewed to pass the error log content directly or via a correctly specified path.",
