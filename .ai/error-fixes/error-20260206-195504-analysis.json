  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent encountered an issue retrieving the primary error log for analysis. The input file 'issue_body.txt', which is expected to contain the detailed error log from the pipeline failure, was reported as not found.",
  "root_cause": "The immediate root cause is an environmental or workflow configuration issue. The 'issue_body.txt' file, which is crucial for the agent to perform its analysis of the pipeline failure, could not be located or accessed at the expected path. This prevents the agent from proceeding with the actual error recovery task for the original pipeline failure.",
  "fix_strategy": "The agent cannot proceed with fixing the original pipeline error without access to its error log. The fix strategy is to investigate the preceding steps in the workflow responsible for generating or providing the 'issue_body.txt' file. A human needs to verify that the file is correctly generated, placed in the expected location, and has appropriate permissions for the agent to read it. Once the 'issue_body.txt' is available, the agent can be re-invoked.",

  "confidence": "Low - The agent cannot perform its primary function without the actual error log. While the identification of the missing input is high confidence, the ability to resolve the original pipeline failure is currently blocked.",
