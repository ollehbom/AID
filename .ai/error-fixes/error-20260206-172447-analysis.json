  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was unable to proceed with analyzing the pipeline failure because the input error log file, 'issue_body.txt', was not found. This prevents the agent from parsing the actual error details, identifying affected files, or determining a root cause for the original pipeline issue. The current error indicates a problem with the agent's execution environment or the preceding step that is supposed to provide the error log.",
  "root_cause": "The primary input file 'issue_body.txt', which is expected to contain the detailed error log for analysis, could not be located or accessed by the agent. This is an environmental or configuration issue, likely stemming from the workflow or script that invokes the agent and is responsible for providing the error log as an input file.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the agent cannot access its primary input (the error log), it is impossible to perform the intended error recovery task. The immediate strategy is to report this critical input failure and request human intervention. A human needs to investigate why 'issue_body.txt' was not generated, was not placed in the expected location, or why the agent lacks permissions to read it. No automated code fix can be applied within the repository for this specific issue.",

  "confidence": "Low - The agent cannot perform its core function without the error log. This is a critical input failure.",
