  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was unable to proceed with error analysis because its primary input, 'issue_body.txt' (which should contain the detailed error log for the original pipeline failure), was reported as 'File not found'. This prevents the agent from identifying the root cause and implementing a fix for the actual pipeline error.",
  "root_cause": "The file 'issue_body.txt', essential for the Error Recovery Agent's operation, was missing from the expected location. This indicates a failure in a preceding pipeline step responsible for generating or providing this file, or an incorrect configuration of the agent's input path or permissions. Without this input, the agent cannot perform its designated task.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the agent's input (the error log itself) is missing, a direct automated code fix by the agent is not possible for this specific issue. The strategy is to halt execution and escalate this issue for immediate human review. A human operator needs to investigate the pipeline's preceding steps to determine why 'issue_body.txt' was not created or made accessible to the agent, and then re-trigger the agent with the correct input.",
