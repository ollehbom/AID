  "error_analysis": "The system reported a 'File not found' error for 'issue_body.txt'. This indicates that the input file containing the error log, which the Error Recovery Agent is supposed to process, was not present at the expected location or could not be accessed by the agent's execution environment.",
  "root_cause": "The root cause is an environmental or pipeline configuration issue where the 'issue_body.txt' file, expected to contain the error log for analysis, was not correctly generated or passed to the Error Recovery Agent's execution. The agent cannot proceed without its primary input.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the error is external to the agent's code and relates to its input, the agent cannot implement a direct code fix within the repository. The strategy involves human intervention to investigate why 'issue_body.txt' was not found. This likely requires checking the preceding steps in the pipeline that are responsible for generating and passing this file as an input to the Error Recovery Agent.",
