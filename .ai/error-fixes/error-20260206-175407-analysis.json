  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was unable to proceed with the error analysis because the error log file, 'issue_body.txt', could not be found. This prevents identification of the original pipeline failure's error type, affected files, and root cause.",
  "root_cause": "The primary root cause is the absence of the 'issue_body.txt' file, which is expected to contain the detailed error log for the pipeline failure. This could be due to a misconfiguration in the preceding steps that generate or provide this file, an incorrect file path being referenced, or a permissions issue preventing access to the file.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the actual error log is unavailable, the agent cannot determine or implement a fix for the original pipeline failure. The immediate strategy is to report this critical input failure and request human intervention to investigate why 'issue_body.txt' is missing or inaccessible. No automated code changes can be proposed without the necessary error context.",

  "confidence": "Low - The agent cannot perform its core function of fixing the pipeline error without the error log. Confidence is only in identifying the input failure.",
