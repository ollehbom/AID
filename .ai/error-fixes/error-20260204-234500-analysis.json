  "error_analysis": "The provided error log is generic and does not contain specific error messages, file paths, or tracebacks. It only indicates 'One or more pipeline stages failed.' Without detailed logs from the workflow run, it's impossible to identify the exact nature of the failure (e.g., SyntaxError, ModuleNotFoundError, configuration issue, logic error, etc.) or the specific file and line number where the error occurred.",
  "root_cause": "The immediate root cause for the pipeline failure cannot be determined from the provided generic error log. The underlying issue could be a syntax error, dependency problem, configuration mistake, logic error, or environment issue, but there is no information to pinpoint it. The lack of specific error details is the primary blocker for automated recovery.",
  "fix_strategy": "To proceed with a fix, more detailed error logs are required. The current log only points to a general pipeline failure. The strategy would be to first obtain the full workflow logs from the provided GitHub Actions run URL (https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21692638834). Once detailed error messages, tracebacks, and affected file information are available, I can then apply the standard error recovery process: parse the specific error, read affected files, determine the root cause, and implement a minimal fix. Without these details, no code changes can be proposed.",
