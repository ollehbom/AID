This prevents the agent from performing its primary function of analyzing and fixing the actual pipeline error.",
  "root_cause": "The file 'issue_body.txt' does not exist in the agent's working directory (/home/runner/work/AID/AID). This indicates a failure in the preceding workflow step responsible for extracting the GitHub issue body content and saving it to 'issue_body.txt' for the agent's consumption. Without this input, the agent cannot proceed with any further analysis or fix implementation for the original pipeline error.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the agent cannot access the primary error log, it cannot proceed with analyzing and fixing the original pipeline failure. The immediate fix strategy is to identify and rectify the workflow step that is supposed to generate or place 'issue_body.txt' in the agent's execution environment. This requires human intervention to inspect the CI/CD pipeline configuration that invokes this agent.",
