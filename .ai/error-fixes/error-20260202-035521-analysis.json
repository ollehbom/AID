The log points to the GitHub Actions run: [https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21576745627](https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21576745627).\n\nWithout the detailed logs from the failed workflow run, the Error Recovery Agent cannot identify the exact error type or root cause to implement a targeted fix.\n\n### Error Type\n\nUnknown - Insufficient log details.\n\n### Fix Applied\n\nNo fix has been applied automatically.\n\n### Files Modified\n\nNone.\n\n### Validation\n\nCannot validate without a specific fix.\n\n---\n**Action Required:** Please retrieve the detailed error logs from the linked GitHub Actions run and provide them to the Error Recovery Agent. This will enable a precise analysis and the implementation of a minimal fix.\n\n**Tags:** `needs-human-review`",
  "pr_description": "**Error Recovery Agent: Cannot Auto-Fix - Insufficient Error Details**\n\nThis pull request is a placeholder as the Error Recovery Agent was unable to automatically fix the pipeline failure `error-20260202-035521`.\n\n**Reason:**\nThe provided error log was a high-level pipeline failure notification and did not contain specific error details (e.g., traceback, error message, affected file, line number). To identify the root cause and implement a fix, detailed logs from the GitHub Actions run are required.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nPlease refer to the associated GitHub issue for more details and instructions on how to proceed. The issue has been tagged `needs-human-review`."
