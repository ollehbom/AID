  "error_analysis": "The primary error log, expected to be in 'issue_body.txt', was not found. This prevents the Error Recovery Agent from performing its core function of analyzing and fixing the actual pipeline failure. The agent received '[File not found: issue_body.txt]' as its input error log.",
  "root_cause": "The input file 'issue_body.txt', which should contain the detailed error log for analysis, is missing or inaccessible at the specified path '/home/runner/work/AID/AID/issue_body.txt'. This indicates an issue with the preceding steps in the pipeline that are responsible for generating or providing this file to the Error Recovery Agent.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the error log cannot be accessed, the agent cannot proceed with analyzing the original pipeline failure. The immediate fix strategy is to halt execution and request human intervention to investigate why 'issue_body.txt' is missing. This likely involves checking the workflow steps that generate or pass this file, ensuring correct paths and file generation. No code changes are proposed as the root cause is external to the repository's code.",
