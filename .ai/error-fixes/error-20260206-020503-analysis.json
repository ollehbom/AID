The file 'issue_body.txt', which should contain the details of the error to be analyzed, is absent. This indicates an issue with the agent's invocation or the preceding steps that are supposed to generate and make this file available.",

The immediate strategy is to report this critical input failure, halt further automated processing, and flag the task for human review.
