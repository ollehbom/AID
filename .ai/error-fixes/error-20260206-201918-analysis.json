  "error_analysis": "The error log itself was not found. The input indicated \"[File not found: issue_body.txt]\", which means the primary information needed to diagnose a pipeline failure was missing. Without the actual error log, a proper analysis of the original pipeline issue cannot be performed.",
  "root_cause": "The agent was unable to access or locate the `issue_body.txt` file, which is expected to contain the detailed error log for the pipeline failure. This indicates an issue with the input mechanism or the environment providing the error context to the agent, rather than a problem within the target repository code.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the error log is missing, the immediate fix strategy is to halt automatic processing and request human intervention. A human needs to ensure that the `issue_body.txt` file containing the relevant error log is correctly generated and provided to the Error Recovery Agent for subsequent analysis. No code changes can be made to the target repository without the actual error details.",

  "confidence": "Low - The agent cannot proceed with fixing the original pipeline error without the error log. This is a critical input failure.",
