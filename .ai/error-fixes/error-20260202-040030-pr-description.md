This PR is a placeholder. No automatic fix could be generated because the provided error log was too generic ('Pipeline Failure') and did not contain specific error details (traceback, file, line number). Manual investigation of the detailed GitHub Actions workflow logs is required to identify the root cause and implement a fix.
