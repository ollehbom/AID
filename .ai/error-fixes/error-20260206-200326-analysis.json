  "error_analysis": "The agent encountered a 'File not found' error when attempting to read 'issue_body.txt'. This file is expected to contain the detailed error log for the pipeline failure that the agent is supposed to analyze and fix. The absence of this input file prevents the agent from performing its primary task of diagnosing and resolving the original pipeline error. This indicates an issue with the pipeline's execution environment or the mechanism responsible for providing the error log to the agent.",
  "root_cause": "The file 'issue_body.txt', which is a critical input for the Error Recovery Agent containing the full error log, was not present at the expected path. This is an environmental or configuration issue within the pipeline that invokes the agent, rather than an error in the repository's code. Without the actual error log, the agent cannot identify the root cause of the original pipeline failure.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the essential input (the error log in 'issue_body.txt') is missing, the agent cannot proceed with analyzing or fixing the original pipeline error. The strategy is to report this critical input failure, classify it as an environment issue, and explicitly flag it for human review. No code modifications can be made to the repository to resolve this specific 'File not found' error, as it pertains to the agent's operational environment and input mechanism. A human operator needs to investigate why 'issue_body.txt' was not generated or passed correctly.",
