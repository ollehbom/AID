  "error_analysis": "The provided error log indicates \"[File not found: issue_body.txt]\". This means the actual error details for the pipeline failure were not supplied to the agent. The agent received an error message indicating that the file expected to contain the error log (issue_body.txt) could not be located by the upstream process responsible for invoking this agent. Without the actual pipeline error log, it is impossible to perform an analysis of the original pipeline failure or identify its root cause.",
  "root_cause": "The root cause is an environmental or tooling issue in the workflow preceding the Error Recovery Agent. The file 'issue_body.txt', which should contain the detailed error log of the pipeline failure, was not found at the expected location or was not correctly passed as input. This prevents the agent from accessing the necessary information to diagnose and fix the pipeline problem.",
  "fix_strategy": "The immediate fix strategy must address the 'File not found: issue_body.txt' error. This requires human intervention to investigate the upstream process that prepares the input for the Error Recovery Agent. Steps include: 1. Verify the existence and correct path of 'issue_body.txt' in the environment where the agent is invoked. 2. Ensure the process generating 'issue_body.txt' completes successfully and places the file in an accessible location. 3. Confirm that the mechanism passing the error log to the agent is correctly configured. No code changes within the repository can be made to resolve this input issue.",
