  "error_analysis": "The provided error log indicates \"[File not found: issue_body.txt]\". This means the actual error details required for analysis were not supplied to the agent. Without the content of `issue_body.txt`, it is impossible to identify the specific error type, affected files, line numbers, or the root cause of the original pipeline failure.",
  "root_cause": "The immediate root cause of *this agent's inability to perform its task* is the absence of the error log file (`issue_body.txt`) that was expected as input. This suggests an upstream issue in the pipeline or the environment that failed to provide the necessary context for error recovery.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the error log itself is missing, no code fix can be proposed for the original pipeline failure. The strategy is to report this input deficiency and flag for human review. A human operator needs to investigate why `issue_body.txt` was not found or provided to the agent, and then re-trigger the agent with the correct error log.",
