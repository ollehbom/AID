  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent encountered a 'File not found' error for 'issue_body.txt'. This file is critical as it is expected to contain the error log from the pipeline failure that the agent is tasked to analyze and fix. Without this input, the agent cannot perform its primary function of error analysis and fix implementation.",
  "root_cause": "The 'issue_body.txt' file, which should contain the detailed error log for analysis, was not found at the expected path '/home/runner/work/AID/AID/issue_body.txt'. This indicates a failure in a preceding pipeline step responsible for generating, populating, or making this file accessible to the agent's execution environment.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the agent's essential input (the error log) is missing, a code fix within the target repository is not applicable at this stage. The immediate fix strategy is to investigate and resolve the issue within the pipeline's execution environment that prevents 'issue_body.txt' from being created or found. This requires human intervention to debug the agent's input pipeline, ensuring the file is correctly generated, populated, and made available for subsequent agent runs.",

  "confidence": "Low - The agent cannot proceed with the original error analysis without the 'issue_body.txt' input. This confidence level reflects the inability to address the original pipeline error, not the confidence in identifying this meta-error.",
