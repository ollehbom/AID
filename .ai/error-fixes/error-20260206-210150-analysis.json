  "error_analysis": "The error log indicates that the file 'issue_body.txt' was not found. This file is crucial for the Error Recovery Agent to parse the GitHub issue body and perform its analysis. Without this input, the agent cannot proceed with identifying the specific error details or implementing a fix for the original problem.",
  "root_cause": "The root cause is an environmental or pipeline configuration issue where the 'issue_body.txt' file, which is expected to be generated or placed in the working directory by a preceding pipeline step, is missing. This prevents the Error Recovery Agent from accessing the necessary context to perform its task.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the error is the absence of the agent's input file rather than an error within a repository file, the agent cannot implement a direct code fix. The strategy is to report this critical input failure, explain the root cause, and request human intervention to rectify the pipeline's input preparation step. No file modifications will be made by the agent.",
  "file_fixes": [],
  "confidence": "Low - The agent cannot resolve this issue autonomously as it pertains to its own operational input rather than a fixable code error within the repository.",
