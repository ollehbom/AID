  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was invoked, but its primary input file, 'issue_body.txt', which is expected to contain the detailed error log for analysis, was not found in the execution environment. This prevents the agent from performing any further error analysis or proposing a fix for the original pipeline failure.",
  "root_cause": "The pipeline step preceding the Error Recovery Agent failed to correctly capture or provide the error log in the expected 'issue_body.txt' file. This is an environmental or workflow configuration issue, indicating a failure in the agent's invocation mechanism rather than an error within the application code itself.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the agent's input (the error log) is missing, it cannot proceed with its task of analyzing and fixing the original pipeline error. The fix strategy involves addressing the upstream process that failed to provide the 'issue_body.txt' file. This requires manual intervention to debug the pipeline's input preparation step, ensuring that the error log is correctly captured and made available to the agent.",
