  "error_analysis": "The provided error log states \"[File not found: issue_body.txt]\". This indicates that the actual error log from the pipeline, which is crucial for analysis, could not be retrieved or was not passed to the agent. Without the specific error details (error type, traceback, affected files, etc.), it is impossible to diagnose the original pipeline failure.",
  "root_cause": "The root cause for the agent's inability to proceed with the task is the absence of the actual error log. This prevents any analysis or fix implementation for the pipeline failure. The underlying cause of the 'File not found: issue_body.txt' error itself is external to this agent's scope, likely an issue with the preceding step that collects and passes the error information.",
  "fix_strategy": "Given the critical absence of the error log, no automated fix can be determined or applied for the original pipeline failure. The immediate strategy is to report this information gap and escalate for human intervention. A human needs to investigate why the error log was not found and provide the correct error context for further analysis.",
