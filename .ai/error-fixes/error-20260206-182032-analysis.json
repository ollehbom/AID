The file 'issue_body.txt', which is expected to contain the error log extracted from the GitHub issue, was not found in the working directory. This prevents the agent from performing its primary function of analyzing the actual pipeline error.",
  "root_cause": "The `issue_body.txt` file is missing from the execution environment. This indicates a failure in the preceding pipeline step responsible for extracting the error log from the GitHub issue and writing it to this file. Without this input, the agent cannot proceed with analyzing the original pipeline error.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the primary input (the error log) is missing, the agent cannot perform its intended function of analyzing and fixing the original pipeline error. The immediate strategy is to report this critical dependency failure and request human intervention to investigate the upstream process that failed to provide the `issue_body.txt` file. No automated code fix can be applied by this agent to resolve the missing input file itself. The human reviewer should ensure the error log is correctly passed to the agent.",
