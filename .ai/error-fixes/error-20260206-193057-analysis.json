  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was unable to proceed with its task because the error log file, specified as 'issue_body.txt', was not found. This indicates a failure in the pipeline's mechanism for providing the error context to the agent, rather than an error within the application code itself.",
  "root_cause": "The primary root cause is an environmental or configuration issue within the AID pipeline orchestration. The necessary input file ('issue_body.txt') containing the actual error log was not accessible or provided to the Error Recovery Agent's execution environment. This prevents the agent from performing any analysis or generating a fix for the original pipeline failure.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the actual error log is missing, no code-level fix can be applied to the application. The strategy is to report this meta-error, flag it for immediate human review, and investigate the pipeline's input mechanism to ensure that error logs are correctly passed to the Error Recovery Agent in future runs. This is an issue with the agent's operating environment, not the target repository code.",
  "file_fixes": [],
  "confidence": "Low - The agent cannot perform its primary function without the error log. Confidence pertains to the ability to fix the *original* error, which is currently impossible.",
