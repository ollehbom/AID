  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent failed to retrieve the error log for `error-20260206-190631` because the file `issue_body.txt` was not found at the expected location. This prevents any further analysis of the original pipeline failure that triggered this agent.",
  "root_cause": "The immediate root cause is the absence of `issue_body.txt`. This could be due to several reasons: 1. The preceding step in the pipeline, responsible for generating or placing `issue_body.txt`, failed or did not complete successfully. 2. The path used by the Error Recovery Agent to access `issue_body.txt` is incorrect or misconfigured. 3. There are permission issues preventing the agent from reading the file if it exists. Without this input, the actual pipeline error cannot be determined or addressed.",
  "fix_strategy": "The primary strategy is to investigate why `issue_body.txt` is missing. This involves checking the pipeline's execution logs for the steps preceding the Error Recovery Agent's invocation. Specifically, verify: 1. That the step intended to generate `issue_body.txt` executed successfully. 2. The exact path where `issue_body.txt` is expected to be created. 3. The permissions of the directory and file. Since the agent's input is missing, an automated code fix for the original pipeline problem is not possible at this stage. Human intervention is required to diagnose and resolve the input file issue.",
