This PR is a placeholder or an indication that the Error Recovery Agent could not automatically fix the pipeline failure `error-20260204-213811`.

**Reason:** The provided error log was too generic, only indicating a general pipeline failure without specific error messages, tracebacks, or file paths. 

**Action Required:** Manual inspection of the workflow run logs at https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21689285658 is necessary to identify the root cause. Once specific error details are available, the agent can be re-invoked.
