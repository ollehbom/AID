  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent encountered a 'File not found' error when attempting to read 'issue_body.txt'. This file is expected to contain the detailed error log of the pipeline failure that the agent is designed to address. Without this critical input, the agent cannot proceed with its primary task of analyzing and fixing the original pipeline issue.",
  "root_cause": "The primary cause is an environmental or workflow configuration issue. The 'issue_body.txt' file, which should contain the error log for analysis, was not present or accessible at the expected location (/home/runner/work/AID/AID/issue_body.txt, or relative to it) at the time the Error Recovery Agent was invoked. This indicates a failure in a preceding step responsible for generating or passing this input to the agent.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the error is the absence of the agent's own input, no direct code modification can be made within the repository to resolve this. The fix requires intervention at the workflow or invocation level to ensure that 'issue_body.txt' is correctly generated and made available to the agent. This could involve checking previous workflow steps, file paths, or permissions. The agent cannot infer or create the content of this missing file.",
