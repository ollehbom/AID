  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent failed to initiate its analysis because the expected input file, 'issue_body.txt', was not found in the current working directory. This file is crucial as it is supposed to contain the error log from the pipeline failure that the agent needs to process. Without this input, the agent cannot proceed with identifying the root cause or formulating a fix for the original error.",
  "root_cause": "The primary root cause is the absence of 'issue_body.txt'. This indicates a failure in the preceding steps of the CI/CD pipeline or the agent's invocation mechanism. Specifically, the workflow step responsible for generating and placing the error log into 'issue_body.txt' either did not execute successfully, failed to write the file, or placed it in an unexpected location. This is an environmental or configuration issue related to the agent's execution context, not an error within the target repository's code.",
  "fix_strategy": "The fix for this issue requires an investigation and modification of the pipeline workflow that invokes the Error Recovery Agent. The strategy involves: 1. Verifying the step immediately preceding the agent's execution to ensure it successfully captures the error log. 2. Confirming that the captured error log is written to a file named 'issue_body.txt'. 3. Ensuring 'issue_body.txt' is placed in the expected working directory from which the Error Recovery Agent is launched. 4. Checking for any permission issues that might prevent file creation or access. No code changes are required in the target repository for this specific error.",
