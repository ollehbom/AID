  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was invoked to analyze and fix a pipeline error, but the input error log file, 'issue_body.txt', could not be found in the expected working directory. This prevents the agent from performing its primary function of analyzing the root cause of the original pipeline failure.",
  "root_cause": "The file 'issue_body.txt', which is expected to contain the detailed error log for the agent to process, is missing. This indicates a failure in the preceding step of the pipeline responsible for capturing and providing the error log to the Error Recovery Agent. Without this input, the agent cannot identify the original error type, affected files, or propose a fix for the actual pipeline failure.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the agent's input (the error log) is missing, no direct code fix can be applied to the application. The immediate strategy is to halt execution, report the missing input, and request human intervention. A human operator needs to investigate the workflow that invokes this agent to ensure the error log is correctly captured from the failing pipeline step and made available to the agent, either by writing it to 'issue_body.txt' or by passing it directly as an argument.",
