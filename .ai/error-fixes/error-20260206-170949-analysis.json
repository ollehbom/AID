  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent failed to locate its input file, 'issue_body.txt', which is expected to contain the error log for analysis. This prevents the agent from proceeding with any error recovery tasks and indicates a failure in the pipeline's setup phase for the agent.",
  "root_cause": "The most probable root cause is a misconfiguration or failure in the CI/CD pipeline step responsible for preparing the agent's execution environment. Specifically, the step that is supposed to extract the GitHub issue body and save it as 'issue_body.txt' (or ensure it's accessible) either failed to execute, placed the file in an incorrect location, or the agent's invocation path is incorrect. This is an environmental setup issue within the CI/CD pipeline itself, rather than a code error within the AID repository's core logic.",
  "fix_strategy": "The fix requires an adjustment to the CI/CD workflow (e.g., '.github/workflows/error-fix.yml') that invokes the Error Recovery Agent. A step must be added or corrected to ensure that the content of the GitHub issue body is correctly written to a file named 'issue_body.txt' in the agent's working directory ('/home/runner/work/AID/AID') before the agent's script is run. For example, a 'run' step could use 'github.event.issue.body' to create this file. This ensures the agent has the necessary input to perform its analysis.",
  "file_fixes": [],
  "confidence": "High. The error message is explicit about a missing file, and the context points to an input file for the agent's operation.",
