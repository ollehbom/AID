  "error_analysis": "The pipeline execution failed because the required input file 'issue_body.txt' was not found. This file is essential for the Error Recovery Agent to parse the error log and understand the context of the failure. The absence of this file indicates an issue with the preceding steps in the CI/CD pipeline that are responsible for preparing the environment and input for the agent.",
  "root_cause": "The root cause is an environmental issue within the CI/CD pipeline. The 'issue_body.txt' file, which is expected to contain the GitHub issue body and the detailed error log for analysis, was not created or was not accessible at the expected path within the agent's execution environment. This points to a misconfiguration or failure in a preceding workflow step that is responsible for extracting information from the GitHub issue and writing it to this specific file.",
  "fix_strategy": "The fix requires a modification to the CI/CD workflow definition itself (e.g., in the `.github/workflows/error-fix.yml` file). The specific step responsible for extracting the GitHub issue body and saving its content as 'issue_body.txt' needs to be identified and corrected. This might involve ensuring the file is correctly created, has appropriate permissions, or is placed in the correct working directory before the Error Recovery Agent is invoked. No changes are required in the application's source code files within the repository.",
