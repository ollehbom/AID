  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was unable to proceed with analyzing the pipeline failure because its primary input, the error log file named \"issue_body.txt\", was not found. This prevents any further analysis of the actual pipeline error that triggered the agent.",
  "root_cause": "The file \"issue_body.txt\", which is expected to contain the detailed error log from the failed pipeline run, is missing from the agent's execution environment. This indicates an issue with the preceding step in the workflow responsible for capturing and providing the error log as input to the Error Recovery Agent.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the agent cannot access the error log, it cannot perform a code-level fix for the original pipeline failure. The immediate fix is to address the missing input file. This requires human intervention to investigate the workflow or script that invokes the Error Recovery Agent to ensure that \"issue_body.txt\" is correctly generated, populated with the error log, and made accessible to the agent. No file modifications within the repository are applicable for this specific error.",
