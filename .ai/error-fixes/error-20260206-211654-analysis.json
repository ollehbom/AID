  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent encountered a 'File not found' error for 'issue_body.txt'. This indicates that the agent was unable to retrieve the necessary error log information, as the file expected to contain the GitHub issue body (which should include the pipeline error log) was not present or accessible at the specified path.",
  "root_cause": "The `issue_body.txt` file, which is crucial for the Error Recovery Agent to perform its analysis, was not found. This suggests a failure in the preceding workflow step responsible for extracting the GitHub issue body content and making it available to the agent, or an incorrect path being used to access this file. Without the actual error log, the agent cannot proceed with the intended error recovery task.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the agent cannot proceed without the actual error log, the immediate fix is to address the input mechanism. The workflow step that invokes this agent needs to be reviewed. It must ensure that the content of the GitHub issue body (containing the pipeline error log) is correctly extracted and written to a file named `issue_body.txt` in a location accessible to the agent, or passed directly as an input parameter. If the file is expected in the current working directory, verify the preceding step correctly places it there. No code changes are proposed for the repository itself, as the error is external to the application code and relates to the agent's execution environment/input.",
