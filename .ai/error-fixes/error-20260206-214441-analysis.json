  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was invoked, but the crucial input file 'issue_body.txt', which is expected to contain the detailed error log for analysis, was reported as 'File not found'. This prevents the agent from performing its primary function of analyzing and fixing code errors within the application.",
  "root_cause": "The system failed to retrieve the `issue_body.txt` file. This indicates a failure in the preceding pipeline step responsible for generating or providing the error log context to the Error Recovery Agent. Possible causes include an incorrect file path, the file not being created, or permission issues preventing access to the file.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the actual error log is missing, the agent cannot proceed with code analysis or generate a code fix for the original pipeline failure. The immediate strategy is to report this input failure. A human intervention is required to investigate why `issue_body.txt` was not available. This might involve checking the pipeline's error log extraction step, verifying file paths, or reviewing permissions in the environment where the agent is executed.",
