  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was unable to proceed with the primary task of analyzing a pipeline error because the required input file, 'issue_body.txt', which should contain the error log, was reported as 'File not found'. This prevents any analysis of the original pipeline failure that triggered this agent.",
  "root_cause": "The input file 'issue_body.txt' was not found at the expected location. This indicates a failure in the preceding CI/CD workflow steps responsible for generating or providing this file, or an incorrect path configuration for the agent's input. Without this file, the agent cannot access the error log details.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the agent cannot analyze the original error without the log, the immediate fix strategy is to address the missing 'issue_body.txt'. This involves reviewing the CI/CD workflow definition (e.g., a GitHub Actions workflow file) to ensure that the step responsible for generating or providing 'issue_body.txt' successfully creates the file and places it in an accessible location, and that the Error Recovery Agent is configured to read from the correct path. No direct code changes within the repository are applicable for this specific meta-error.",
