  "error_analysis": "The pipeline execution failed because the required input file 'issue_body.txt' was not found in the expected location. This file is critical for the Error Recovery Agent to parse the error log and proceed with its task. The absence of this file indicates a failure in a preceding pipeline step responsible for generating or providing this context.",
  "root_cause": "The root cause is an environmental or configuration issue within the pipeline. A previous step failed to create or correctly place 'issue_body.txt', or the current step is looking for the file in an incorrect path. This prevents the Error Recovery Agent from receiving its necessary input.",
  "fix_strategy": "The fix strategy involves debugging the pipeline's preceding steps to ensure 'issue_body.txt' is correctly generated and made available to the Error Recovery Agent. This might involve: 1. Verifying the script or command that is supposed to create 'issue_body.txt'. 2. Checking the file path and permissions where 'issue_body.txt' is expected. 3. Ensuring any necessary environment variables or inputs for the file generation are correctly set. This fix cannot be applied directly by modifying code files within the repository by this agent, as it's an external pipeline configuration issue.",
