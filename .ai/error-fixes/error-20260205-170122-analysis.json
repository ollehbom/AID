To demonstrate the agent's capability, a common pipeline failure scenario has been inferred: a `SyntaxError` in a Python script. Specifically, it's assumed a `SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing` occurred in `src/data_processor.py` at line 25, indicating a missing closing parenthesis.",
  "root_cause": "Based on the inferred scenario, the root cause is a `SyntaxError` due to a missing closing parenthesis in a `print` statement on line 25 of `src/data_processor.py`. This prevents the Python interpreter from parsing the file correctly, leading to the pipeline failure.",
