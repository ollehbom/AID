  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was invoked, but the provided 'Error Log' indicates a 'File not found: issue_body.txt' error. This means the agent could not access the actual pipeline error log that it was supposed to analyze. Without the content of 'issue_body.txt', the agent cannot perform its core function of analyzing the pipeline failure and proposing a fix.",
  "root_cause": "The immediate root cause is an environmental or configuration issue preventing the Error Recovery Agent from accessing the 'issue_body.txt' file. This file is expected to contain the detailed error log of the pipeline failure. The agent's invocation mechanism or environment setup failed to provide the necessary input.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the error is external to the pipeline's code and within the agent's invocation environment (i.e., the agent itself cannot find its input), the agent cannot directly implement a fix. The strategy is to report the inability to proceed due to missing input, identify the specific missing file, and request immediate human intervention to resolve the 'issue_body.txt' file access issue. Once the correct error log is made available, the agent can then proceed with its intended error recovery task for the pipeline failure.",
