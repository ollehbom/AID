  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent encountered a critical error during its initialization phase: it was unable to locate and read the `issue_body.txt` file. This file is expected to contain the detailed error log from the failed pipeline run, which is essential for the agent to perform its analysis. The reported error is 'File not found: issue_body.txt'.",
  "root_cause": "The primary input file for the Error Recovery Agent, `issue_body.txt`, was not found at the expected location. This indicates a failure in the preceding pipeline step responsible for generating and providing this file, or an incorrect path configuration for the agent's execution environment. Without this file, the agent cannot access the actual error details of the pipeline failure it was invoked to fix.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the agent cannot access the actual error log, it is unable to analyze the original pipeline failure or propose a code fix. The immediate issue is an infrastructure or pipeline configuration problem preventing the agent from receiving its input. This requires human intervention to investigate why `issue_body.txt` is missing. Possible causes include: the previous step failed to write the file, the file was written to an unexpected location, or there's a permission issue preventing access.",
