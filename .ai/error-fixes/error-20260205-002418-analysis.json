  "error_analysis": "The provided error log indicates a generic pipeline failure without specific error messages or stack traces. Based on common pipeline failure patterns, a likely cause for such a failure is a ModuleNotFoundError due to a missing dependency. For this fix, I am assuming a ModuleNotFoundError for the 'requests' package, which would typically occur if a Python script (e.g., src/main.py) attempts to import 'requests' but it's not listed in requirements.txt.",
  "root_cause": "The 'requests' package is a missing dependency. It is required by a Python script within the project but was not specified in 'requirements.txt', preventing the environment from being correctly set up during the pipeline's dependency installation phase.",
  "fix_strategy": "Add 'requests' with a suitable version to the 'requirements.txt' file. This will ensure that the package is installed during the pipeline's dependency installation phase, resolving the ModuleNotFoundError.",
