Without access to the actual error log, the agent cannot proceed with analyzing the root cause of the original pipeline failure or propose a code fix.",
  "root_cause": "The system failed to retrieve the error log from 'issue_body.txt'. This indicates an issue with the pipeline's execution environment, the preceding step that should generate or place this file, or the path used to access it. It is not an error within the application code itself, but rather an operational or pipeline configuration issue.",
  "fix_strategy": "The immediate fix strategy is to address why 'issue_body.txt' was not found. This requires human intervention to: 1. Verify the pipeline step responsible for generating or providing 'issue_body.txt' is executing correctly. 2. Check the exact path and filename expected for 'issue_body.txt' within the pipeline's execution context. 3. Ensure proper permissions are set for the runner to access the file. Once the 'issue_body.txt' is accessible, the agent can then re-run to analyze the original error.",
