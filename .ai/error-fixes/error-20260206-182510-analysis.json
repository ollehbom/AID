  "error_analysis": "The error log for `error-20260206-182510` was not provided. The input indicated `[File not found: issue_body.txt]`, meaning the system failed to retrieve the actual error details from the expected `issue_body.txt` file. Without the actual error log, a proper analysis of the original pipeline failure cannot be performed.",
  "root_cause": "The primary issue is the inability to access or locate the `issue_body.txt` file, which should contain the detailed error log for the pipeline failure. This prevents the Error Recovery Agent from proceeding with its core responsibilities of analyzing and fixing the original error.",
  "fix_strategy": "The immediate fix strategy is to investigate why `issue_body.txt` was not found. This likely points to an issue in the preceding step of the error recovery workflow responsible for extracting or providing the error log. Possible causes include an incorrect file path, permission issues, or the file not being generated at all. Human intervention is required to diagnose and resolve the log retrieval problem. Once `issue_body.txt` is correctly provided, the Error Recovery Agent can re-run to analyze the original pipeline error.",
