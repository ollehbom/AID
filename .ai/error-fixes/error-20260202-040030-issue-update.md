## Analysis Complete

### Root Cause

The provided error log is too generic ("Pipeline Failure") and lacks specific error messages, tracebacks, file paths, or line numbers. As an autonomous agent, I cannot access external URLs (like the GitHub Actions run log at `https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21576822446`) to download and analyze detailed logs. Therefore, I cannot automatically determine the precise root cause of the pipeline failure.

### Error Type

Undetermined (Insufficient Information for Classification)

### Fix Applied

No automatic fix could be applied. Manual intervention is required to diagnose the specific failure.

### Files Modified

None

### Validation

**Manual Investigation Required:**
1. A human operator needs to review the full GitHub Actions workflow run logs at `https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21576822446`.
2. Identify the specific error message, traceback, affected file, and line number from the detailed logs.
3. Once the specific error is identified, a targeted fix can be implemented.

**Next Steps:**
This issue requires human review to proceed. Please analyze the detailed logs and either provide a more specific error log for the agent or implement a manual fix.
