  "error_analysis": "The primary error encountered is that the error log file, \"issue_body.txt\", which is essential for analyzing the pipeline failure, was reported as 'File not found'. This prevents any further analysis of the original pipeline error (error-20260206-184219).",
  "root_cause": "The root cause of this agent's inability to proceed is the absence of \"issue_body.txt\". This could be due to several reasons: the file was not generated by the preceding step, it was generated in an unexpected location, or there are permission issues preventing access. Without this file, the agent cannot parse the actual pipeline error details.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the error log itself is missing, a direct fix for the original pipeline error cannot be determined or applied. The immediate strategy is to halt execution and require human intervention to investigate why \"issue_body.txt\" is missing. This involves checking the preceding steps in the workflow that are responsible for generating and providing the error log, verifying file paths, and ensuring proper permissions. Once \"issue_body.txt\" is available, the agent can be re-invoked.",
