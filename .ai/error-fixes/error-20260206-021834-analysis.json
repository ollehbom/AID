  "root_cause": "The primary root cause is an environmental or configuration issue where the input error log (`issue_body.txt`) was not accessible or did not exist in the agent's execution context. Without this log, the agent cannot identify the actual pipeline failure.",
  "fix_strategy": "The immediate fix strategy is to address the missing input file. This requires human intervention to investigate why 'issue_body.txt' was not provided or found. Potential causes include incorrect file path, a failure in the preceding step that was supposed to generate this file, or incorrect mounting of the workspace. No code changes can be proposed for the original pipeline error without its log.",
