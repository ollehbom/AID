  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was unable to proceed with analyzing the pipeline failure because the input error log file, 'issue_body.txt', was not found. This critical input is required to identify the root cause and implement fixes for the original pipeline error. Without the error log, no specific code analysis or modification can be performed.",
  "root_cause": "The 'issue_body.txt' file, which is expected to contain the detailed error log from the pipeline failure, was reported as 'File not found'. This indicates an issue in the preceding steps of the error-fix workflow responsible for generating, retrieving, or passing this file to the Error Recovery Agent's execution environment. It is an environmental or workflow configuration issue rather than an error within the user's application code.",
  "fix_strategy": "The immediate fix strategy is to address the 'File not found' error for 'issue_body.txt'. This requires human intervention to investigate the error-fix workflow itself. Steps should include: 1. Verify that the 'issue_body.txt' file is indeed being generated by the preceding workflow steps. 2. Check the path where the agent expects to find 'issue_body.txt' against the actual location where it is generated. 3. Ensure proper permissions are set for the agent to read the file. 4. If the file is missing entirely, debug the process responsible for creating it. No code changes will be made to the application repository based on this specific error.",
