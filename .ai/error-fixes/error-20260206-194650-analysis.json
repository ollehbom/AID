  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent encountered a critical issue: the specified error log file, 'issue_body.txt', was not found. This prevents the agent from performing any analysis or attempting to fix the original pipeline failure, as the necessary context is missing.",
  "root_cause": "The input mechanism for the Error Recovery Agent failed to provide the error log. Specifically, the file 'issue_body.txt', which is expected to contain the detailed error information for the pipeline failure, could not be located or accessed. This is an environmental or configuration issue within the agent's execution context, rather than a pipeline code error.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the actual error log for the pipeline failure is unavailable, the agent cannot proceed with its primary task. The immediate strategy is to report this input file access error, indicate that the original pipeline error cannot be analyzed, and request human intervention to ensure the error log is correctly provided or accessible in subsequent runs.",
