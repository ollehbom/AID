  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent encountered an error indicating that its primary input file, 'issue_body.txt', was not found. This file is expected to contain the detailed error log of the pipeline failure that the agent is supposed to analyze and fix. Consequently, the agent cannot proceed with its core function of diagnosing and resolving the actual pipeline issue. The current problem is an operational or environmental issue preventing the agent from receiving its necessary context.",
  "root_cause": "The file 'issue_body.txt', which is a critical input for the Error Recovery Agent and should contain the pipeline's error log, was either not generated, not passed correctly, or is inaccessible at the expected path '/home/runner/work/AID/AID/issue_body.txt'. This indicates a failure in the preceding workflow steps responsible for preparing the agent's execution environment or providing its inputs.",
  "fix_strategy": "Given that the essential error log is missing, the Error Recovery Agent cannot perform any analysis or implement any fixes related to a pipeline error. The immediate strategy is to report this critical input failure and request human intervention. A human operator needs to investigate the workflow that invokes this agent to determine why 'issue_body.txt' was not created or made available. No automated code changes can be made by the agent to resolve this input problem.",

  "confidence": "Low - The agent is confident that its input is missing, but cannot proceed with its primary task. It requires human intervention to resolve the input issue before it can attempt to fix any pipeline errors.",
