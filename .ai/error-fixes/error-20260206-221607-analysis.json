  "root_cause": "The pipeline execution environment or the mechanism responsible for providing the error log to the agent did not correctly supply the 'issue_body.txt' file. This indicates an issue with the agent's invocation or the preceding steps in the error-fix workflow, rather than an error within the application code itself.",

A human intervention is required to investigate why 'issue_body.txt' was missing. This might involve checking the workflow steps that generate or pass this file, ensuring correct file paths, permissions, or existence before invoking the Error Recovery Agent.",
