  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was unable to proceed with analyzing the pipeline failure because the input error log file, 'issue_body.txt', was reported as 'File not found'. This indicates a problem in how the error log is being provided to the agent, preventing it from performing its core function.",
  "root_cause": "The immediate root cause is an environmental or configuration issue where the 'issue_body.txt' file, expected to contain the error log for analysis, does not exist or is not accessible at the specified path within the agent's execution environment. This prevents the agent from parsing any actual pipeline error.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the primary input (the error log) is missing, the agent cannot analyze or propose fixes for the original pipeline error. The strategy is to halt execution, report this input unavailability, and require human intervention to ensure the error log is correctly generated and passed to the agent. Once the 'issue_body.txt' issue is resolved, the agent can be re-invoked to analyze the actual pipeline failure.",
