  "issue_update": "## Analysis Complete\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe provided error log is too generic (\"Pipeline Failure\") and lacks specific error messages, tracebacks, file paths, or line numbers. As an autonomous agent, I cannot access external URLs (like the GitHub Actions run log at `https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21576822446`) to download and analyze detailed logs. Therefore, I cannot automatically determine the precise root cause of the pipeline failure.\n\n### Error Type\n\nUndetermined (Insufficient Information for Classification)\n\n### Fix Applied\n\nNo automatic fix could be applied. Manual intervention is required to diagnose the specific failure.\n\n### Files Modified\n\nNone\n\n### Validation\n\n**Manual Investigation Required:**\n1. A human operator needs to review the full GitHub Actions workflow run logs at `https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21576822446`.\n2. Identify the specific error message, traceback, affected file, and line number from the detailed logs.\n3. Once the specific error is identified, a targeted fix can be implemented.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nThis issue requires human review to proceed. Please analyze the detailed logs and either provide a more specific error log for the agent or implement a manual fix.\n\n/label `needs-human-review`",

No automatic fix could be generated because the provided error log was too generic ('Pipeline Failure') and did not contain specific error details (traceback, file, line number).
