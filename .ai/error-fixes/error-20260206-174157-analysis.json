  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was invoked to analyze an error, but it failed to locate its primary input file, \"issue_body.txt\". This file is expected to contain the detailed error log for analysis. The absence of this file prevents the agent from proceeding with any error analysis or fix implementation.",
  "root_cause": "The root cause is an environmental or pipeline configuration issue where the \"issue_body.txt\" file, which should contain the error log, was not generated or placed in the agent's working directory (\"/home/runner/work/AID/AID\") as expected. This indicates a failure in the preceding step of the pipeline responsible for preparing the agent's input.",
  "fix_strategy": "Given that the agent's input itself is missing, the agent cannot perform a code modification within the repository to resolve this. The fix requires manual intervention to debug and correct the upstream pipeline step responsible for creating and providing the \"issue_body.txt\" file. This is an external issue to the repository's code, affecting the agent's execution environment. Therefore, this task requires human review to investigate the pipeline's execution context and ensure the input file is correctly supplied.",
