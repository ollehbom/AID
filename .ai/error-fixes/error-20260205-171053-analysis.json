Without access to the detailed logs from the workflow run, a precise analysis of the error type and its specifics is not possible.",

The immediate next step is to manually access the GitHub Actions run logs at https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21720865544. Once the detailed error message and traceback are obtained, a targeted fix can be developed based on the identified error type (e.g., Syntax, Dependency, Configuration, Logic, or Environment error).",
