This file is expected to contain the detailed error log for the primary pipeline failure that this agent was tasked to resolve. Without access to \"issue_body.txt\", the agent cannot proceed with analyzing the original error or proposing a fix.",
  "root_cause": "The \"issue_body.txt\" file, which serves as the input for the Error Recovery Agent's analysis, was not found at the expected location or was inaccessible during execution. This indicates an issue with the preceding pipeline step responsible for generating or passing this file, or a misconfiguration in the agent's execution environment regarding file paths or permissions.",
  "fix_strategy": "The agent cannot directly fix the \"File not found\" error for \"issue_body.txt\" as it pertains to the agent's operational environment or the upstream process. The strategy is to halt further automated analysis of the original pipeline error and flag this issue for immediate human review. A human operator needs to investigate why \"issue_body.txt\" was not available, rectify the pipeline's file generation/passing mechanism, or adjust the agent's execution context to correctly locate the input file.",
