  "error_analysis": "The pipeline failed because the input file 'issue_body.txt', which is expected to contain the error log for analysis, was not found at the specified location. This prevents the Error Recovery Agent from performing its analysis and identifying the root cause of the original pipeline failure.",
  "root_cause": "The root cause is an environmental or configuration issue within the workflow that invokes the Error Recovery Agent. The 'issue_body.txt' file, which is a critical input for the agent, is missing. This could be due to a preceding step failing to generate the file, an incorrect path being provided, or insufficient permissions for the agent to access the file.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the 'issue_body.txt' file is an input to the Error Recovery Agent, the agent cannot directly create or modify it. The fix requires human intervention to review the workflow that invokes this agent. Specifically, investigate the step responsible for generating or providing 'issue_body.txt' to ensure it exists, is correctly populated with the error log, and is accessible at the expected path.",
