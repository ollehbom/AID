Without this input, the agent cannot proceed with identifying the root cause or implementing any fixes for the original pipeline failure. The agent's execution environment at '/home/runner/work/AID/AID' did not contain the necessary 'issue_body.txt' file.",
  "root_cause": "The primary input file, 'issue_body.txt', which should contain the error log for analysis, was not found at the expected path. This indicates a failure in the preceding pipeline step responsible for generating or providing this file to the agent. The agent cannot perform its function without access to the error log.",
  "fix_strategy": "Since the agent cannot access its primary input (the error log), it cannot perform any code modifications or automated fixes for the original problem. The strategy is to halt execution, report the input failure, and request immediate human intervention. A human needs to investigate why 'issue_body.txt' was not created or passed correctly to the agent's execution environment. This is an environment/configuration issue with the agent's invocation.",
