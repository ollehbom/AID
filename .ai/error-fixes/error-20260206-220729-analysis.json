  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent encountered a critical issue: the input file 'issue_body.txt', which is expected to contain the detailed error log for analysis, was not found. This prevents the agent from performing any analysis on the actual pipeline failure. The error message 'File not found: issue_body.txt' indicates a failure in the preceding workflow steps to provide the necessary input.",
  "root_cause": "The 'issue_body.txt' file, which serves as the primary input for the Error Recovery Agent, was not present at the expected location. This is likely due to a misconfiguration or failure in the workflow step responsible for generating or passing the error log content into this file before the agent's execution.",
  "fix_strategy": "The immediate fix is to address the workflow configuration that prepares the input for the Error Recovery Agent. This involves: 1. Verifying that the preceding workflow step successfully extracts the error log. 2. Ensuring the extracted error log is correctly written to a file named 'issue_body.txt'. 3. Confirming that 'issue_body.txt' is placed in an accessible location and that the agent has the necessary read permissions. This is an infrastructure/workflow issue, not a code fix within the repository.",
