It directs to a GitHub Actions run URL (https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21693218960) for details. Without direct access to the detailed workflow logs from the provided context, a specific error analysis cannot be performed. The failure is generic, indicating one or more stages failed.",
  "root_cause": "Cannot determine the root cause without specific error logs. The current information only indicates a generic pipeline failure. Detailed logs from the GitHub Actions run are required to pinpoint the exact issue (e.g., syntax error, missing dependency, configuration problem, logic error, or environment issue).",
  "fix_strategy": "Given the lack of specific error details, an automated fix cannot be proposed at this stage. The immediate strategy is to request human intervention to access and provide the detailed error logs from the linked GitHub Actions run. Once specific error messages, file paths, and line numbers are available, the Error Recovery Agent can then proceed with parsing the error, identifying the root cause, classifying the error type, and implementing a minimal, targeted fix according to the established guidelines.",
