  "error_analysis": "The Error Recovery Agent was unable to proceed with the analysis of the pipeline error because its required input file, \"issue_body.txt\", was not found. This file is expected to contain the detailed error log for the pipeline failure. Without this input, the agent cannot identify the specific error type, affected files, or root cause of the original pipeline failure. This is an operational error preventing the agent from performing its core function.",
  "root_cause": "The \"issue_body.txt\" file, which is crucial for the Error Recovery Agent to perform its analysis, was missing from the expected location. This indicates an issue in the preceding pipeline step responsible for generating or providing this file to the agent's execution environment.",
  "fix_strategy": "The immediate fix is to address the missing input file. This requires investigating the pipeline step that invokes the Error Recovery Agent to ensure \"issue_body.txt\" is correctly generated and passed. Since the agent cannot analyze the original pipeline error without this file, no code changes are proposed for the repository itself. The agent recommends human intervention to resolve the missing input and re-trigger the agent with the correct context.",
