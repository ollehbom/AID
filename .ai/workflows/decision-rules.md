# Decision Rules

## Priority

1. Founder intuition
2. Repeated qualitative feedback
3. System friction signals
4. Metrics (only if clear)

## Scope Control

- One active experiment at a time
- Every change must be reversible
- If unsure, reduce scope

## Kill Criteria

- Confusion increases
- Cognitive load increases
- Implementation complexity grows faster than insight

Default action: do less.
