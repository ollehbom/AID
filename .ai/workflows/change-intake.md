# Change Intake Workflow

Purpose:
Convert raw feedback into a clear product decision without premature solutioning.

Steps:

1. Capture feedback verbatim
2. Identify affected belief(s)
3. Decide: ignore, observe, or experiment
4. If experimenting, define smallest reversible change

Rules:

- No design or code at intake
- No prioritization during capture
- Founder intuition overrides volume

Outputs:

- Belief update OR
- Experiment proposal
