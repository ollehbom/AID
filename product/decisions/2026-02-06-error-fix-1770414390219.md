## Decision Record: error-fix-1770414390219 - Establish Foundational UI/UX

### Overview

This decision addresses the founder's direct request to establish the initial user interface and experience for the product. It involves creating a basic React application, integrating a modern styling framework (shadcn/ui), implementing a Google login flow, and a simple dashboard, all built upon a foundational design system.

### Hypothesis

As a `founding team`
We believe `implementing a React application with shadcn/ui, Google login, a basic dashboard, and a modern design system`
Will result in `a consistent, visually appealing, and rapidly extensible frontend foundation`
Because `this aligns with modern web development best practices and the founder's vision for speed and intuitiveness.`

### Context

- **Affected Belief**: This initiative supports the core beliefs: "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (by establishing a clean, intuitive UI base) and "Users value speed over configurability" (by using a component library that promotes quick development and a streamlined user experience). It also indirectly supports "The primary user is technically competent" by laying a foundation that can be easily understood and extended by such users.
- **Current Workflow**: There is currently no foundational React application or established design system, requiring a new build from scratch.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a consistent UI framework, functional login, or initial dashboard prevents further product development and validation.
- **Success Metric**: The successful deployment of a React application featuring Google login, a basic dashboard, and an integrated shadcn/ui design system, validated by founder approval and readiness for subsequent feature development.
- **Reversibility**: Individual UI components and styling choices are reversible. The choice of React and shadcn/ui as the core framework is a larger commitment, but the scope of this initial implementation is minimal, allowing for pivot if early foundational choices prove problematic (though unlikely given founder directive).

### Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

### Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Founder approval of the implemented React app, functional Google login, basic dashboard, and integrated design system.
- **Target**: 100% functionality of requested core components and founder sign-off.
- **Measured via**: Direct review and feedback from the founder.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of the initial build, estimated within 7 working days.
- **If successful**: This foundational setup will be considered the base for future development, reinforcing the belief that a modern, component-based approach facilitates rapid iteration and a clean user experience.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen framework (shadcn/ui) or implementation approach based on founder feedback, documenting learnings in `product/beliefs/history.md`.
