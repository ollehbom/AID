## Overview

Establish a foundational React application with Shadcn UI, Google login, and a basic dashboard to create a modern, intuitive, and rapidly developable product experience.

## Hypothesis

As a technical founder/developer
I believe using Shadcn UI and a modern design system for a foundational React app (login, dashboard)
Will result in rapid development and an intuitive, fast-feeling product experience for technically competent users
Because it provides pre-built, accessible components and a consistent visual language.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This experiment aims to validate and strengthen the core beliefs: "Users value speed over configurability", "The product must feel obvious without documentation", and "The primary user is technically competent".
- **Current Workflow**: There is currently no functional application foundation.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a consistent, modern UI/UX foundation hinders rapid iteration and user feedback collection.
- **Success Metric**: Successful deployment of the foundational app with functional login and dashboard, and the establishment of a reusable design system.
- **Reversibility**: While the core framework choice is foundational, individual components and design choices can be iterated upon. The initial setup is a commitment to a modern stack, but components are modular.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and running.
- [ ] Shadcn UI integrated and configured as the primary styling framework.
- [ ] Login screen implemented using Google OAuth for authentication.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page with mock content accessible after login.
- [ ] Initial design system (colors, typography, basic components) defined and implemented via Shadcn's theming/components.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable for future features, for this foundational setup, it's the base).
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec.
- [ ] Tests written (e.g., basic component rendering, login flow).
- [ ] Documentation updated (e.g., setup instructions, basic design system guidelines).
- [ ] QA validation passed (functional login, dashboard display, visual consistency).
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (for future features, this is the initial rollout).
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (e.g., initial setup time, developer feedback on ease of use).

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Completion and functional stability of the foundational application and design system. Developer feedback on the efficiency of using Shadcn.
- **Target**: 100% completion of the listed acceptance criteria within the estimated timeframe. Positive developer feedback on the chosen stack.
- **Measured via**: Internal review, functional testing, developer surveys/interviews.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 1-2 weeks of development.
- **If successful**: Update belief to "Core" (or reinforce existing Core beliefs) that this tech stack supports rapid, intuitive development. Proceed with next features.
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in product/beliefs/history.md and document learnings regarding challenges with Shadcn, Google login, or overall development velocity.
