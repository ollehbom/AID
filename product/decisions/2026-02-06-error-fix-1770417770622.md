## Decision Record: error-fix-1770417770622 - Foundational UI Development

### Overview
Initiate the development of the core React application, integrating shadcn/ui for styling, implementing Google login, and creating a basic dashboard as per founder's direction. This establishes the foundational UI/UX framework.

### Hypothesis
As a (future) user,
I believe a modern React application, styled with shadcn/ui, featuring Google login and a basic dashboard,
Will result in a compelling and intuitive initial product experience,
Because establishing a robust design system and modern UI foundation is critical for future feature development and user adoption.

### Context
- **Affected Belief**: Implicit belief: "A modern, intuitive UI is essential for initial user engagement and product viability." This also supports "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by establishing a clean design.
- **Current Workflow**: No existing product or user workflow.
- **Pain Point**: The product does not exist yet; lack of a foundational UI/UX.
- **Success Metric**: A deployed React application with a functional Google login, a basic dashboard, and an integrated shadcn/ui design system.
- **Reversibility**: The core React app and design system are foundational. Reversibility isn't a primary concern for initial scaffolding, but components can be refactored or replaced if needed.

### Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `epic`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

### Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Completion and deployment of the React application with specified features.
- **Target**: 100% completion of the foundational UI: React app, shadcn/ui integration, Google login, basic dashboard, and a reusable design system.
- **Measured via**: Manual review and deployment verification.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of the initial build.
- **If successful**: The foundation is set, and we can proceed with user-facing experiments. The belief regarding the importance of a modern UI will be considered established.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen framework or approach for the foundational build.
