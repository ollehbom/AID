## Overview

This decision establishes the foundational frontend architecture for the product, including a React app, Shadcn UI integration, Google login, a basic dashboard, and a core design system. This is a critical initial step to enable subsequent feature development.

## Hypothesis

As a founder building the initial product,
I believe that establishing a modern, consistent, and performant React application using Shadcn UI components, integrated with Google login and a basic dashboard,
Will result in a robust and intuitive UI/UX foundation that accelerates future feature development and aligns with the product's core beliefs regarding user experience,
Because it provides a standardized, high-quality visual and interactive framework from the outset.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**:
    - "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (Core belief, supported by consistent design system)
    - "Users value speed over configurability" (Core belief, supported by Shadcn's opinionated approach)
    - "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" (Open/Unproven belief, the login screen will be a first test of this)
- **Current Workflow**: There is no current frontend application or design system. Development is starting from scratch.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a standardized, modern, and efficient frontend framework to build upon, leading to potential inconsistencies and slower development cycles.
- **Success Metric**: Founder approval of the initial UI/UX, successful implementation of core components (login, dashboard), and establishment of a clear, reusable design system.
- **Reversibility**: The core technology choice (React, Shadcn) is not easily reversible. However, specific component implementations or dashboard layouts can be iterated upon. This experiment is foundational.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and running.
- [ ] Shadcn UI integrated and basic components (e.g., Button, Input) available.
- [ ] Google login functionality implemented and working.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page with mock content displayed.
- [ ] Core design system principles documented and applied to initial components.
- [ ] Founder review and approval of the initial look and feel.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `epic` (Foundational setup for the entire frontend)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (N/A for core framework, but individual features built on top will use flags)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (initial spec from founder feedback)
- [ ] Tests written (unit tests for components, integration tests for login)
- [ ] Documentation updated (README for project setup, basic design system guidelines)
- [ ] QA validation passed (manual validation of login and dashboard functionality)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A, this is the initial rollout)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A, this establishes the baseline)

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Founder satisfaction with the initial UI/UX and functional components; successful demonstration of Google login and basic dashboard.
- **Target**: 100% founder approval on foundational elements.
- **Measured via**: Direct founder feedback and review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of initial implementation (estimated 1-2 weeks).
- **If successful**: This foundational approach will be adopted for all future frontend development. The "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" belief will be partially validated through the login experience.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate choice of UI framework or design system approach.

## Dependencies

- Blocked by: N/A
- Blocks: All subsequent frontend feature development.
- Related belief: "The product must feel obvious without documentation", "Users value speed over configurability", "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance".
