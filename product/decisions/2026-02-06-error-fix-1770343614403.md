## Overview
Establish the foundational technical and UI stack for the product MVP, including a React application with Shadcn UI, Google authentication, a basic dashboard, and an initial design system.

## Hypothesis
As a technically competent user (and founder), I believe that implementing a modern React application with Shadcn UI, Google login, and a foundational design system will result in a solid, extensible base for rapid feature development and an intuitive initial user experience, because this approach aligns with current best practices for developer experience and user interface design, enabling quick validation of core product ideas.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: This effort supports core beliefs: "Users value speed over configurability", "The primary user is technically competent", and "The product must feel obvious without documentation". It lays the groundwork for testing these beliefs with actual user interaction.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no current application workflow. This is the initial setup.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a functional and modern application base to begin product development and user testing.
- **Success Metric**: Successful deployment of the React app, functional Google login, rendering of the basic dashboard, and establishment of a clear design system structure.
- **Reversibility**: Core framework choice (React/Shadcn) is not easily reversible, but modularity will allow for iteration on individual components and design elements. This is a foundational step, making full "reversibility" less applicable than for a specific feature.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: medium
- **Component**: frontend
- **Phase**: phase-1-mvp

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Completion of core setup components and ability to rapidly prototype new features on this base.
- **Target**: Functional application, Google login working, basic dashboard, design system structure in place within 7 days.
- **Measured via**: Manual verification of deployed application, code review, and developer feedback on ease of use for new feature development.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after initial implementation (approx. 7 days).
- **If successful**: Beliefs around "speed over configurability" and "obvious without documentation" are further supported by a strong foundation. This will allow for subsequent experiments to build upon this base.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate choice of framework/libraries or implementation approach. Document learnings in product/beliefs/history.md.
