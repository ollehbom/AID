## Overview

Establish the foundational React application structure, including a modern design system using `shadcn/ui`, a functional Google login, and a basic dashboard with mock content. This experiment focuses on setting up the core UI/UX framework for the product.

## Hypothesis

As a `developer and future end-user`,
I believe `implementing a React app with shadcn/ui, Google login, and a basic dashboard`
Will result in `a consistent, intuitive, and efficient foundation for future feature development and an initial positive user experience`
Because `it leverages modern UI standards and provides essential user interaction points aligned with our core belief in an obvious product.`

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: `The product must feel obvious without documentation.` (A strong design system contributes to this.)
- **Current Workflow**: `No existing application or UI framework.`
- **Pain Point**: `Lack of a unified design language and core application structure to build upon.`
- **Success Metric**: `Successful implementation and integration of shadcn/ui components, functional Google login, and a navigable basic dashboard.`
- **Reversibility**: `While the design system itself is a foundational commitment, individual components can be swapped or modified. The initial setup is modular.`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and styled with `shadcn/ui`
- [ ] Google login integrated and functional
- [ ] Basic dashboard page accessible after login, displaying mock content
- [ ] UI consistency observed between login and dashboard screens
- [ ] Codebase structured for future modularity

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable for specific features within the setup, e.g., new dashboard components)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (to be created by Design Agent)
- [ ] Tests written (unit tests for components, integration tests for login flow)
- [ ] Documentation updated (e.g., README for setup, component usage guidelines)
- [ ] QA validation passed (functional login, dashboard rendering)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for foundational setup; it's either on or off)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A for foundational setup; success is binary functionality)

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: `Functional Google login, consistent UI using shadcn/ui, basic dashboard displaying mock content.`
- **Target**: `All specified components are fully implemented and integrated, providing a stable base for next steps.`
- **Measured via**: `Manual QA, code review, potential early user feedback.`
- **Timeline**: `Evaluate after 7 days of development.`
- **If successful**: `Proceed with subsequent feature development based on this foundation. Belief in "obvious product" strengthened.`
- **If unsuccessful**: `Re-evaluate choice of UI framework or implementation approach.`

## Dependencies

- Blocked by: `N/A`
- Blocks: `All subsequent UI/UX feature development.`
- Related belief: `The product must feel obvious without documentation.`
