## Overview

Experiment to establish the core React application foundation using `shadcn/ui`, including a Google login, a basic dashboard, and an initial design system.

## Hypothesis

As a developer (and early user),
I believe establishing a `shadcn/ui`-based React app with a foundational design system, login, and basic dashboard
Will result in a rapid and consistent initial development environment,
Because it provides reusable components and a clear visual language, leading to faster feature iteration and an intuitive user experience.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: Supports "Users value speed over configurability," "The primary user is technically competent," and "The product must feel obvious without documentation." This foundational work aims to align the technical stack with these core product beliefs.
- **Current Workflow**: No existing application.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a consistent UI framework and initial application structure, leading to potential inconsistencies and slower development for future features.
- **Success Metric**: Completion of initial setup within 5 working days, successful Google login, and consistent application of `shadcn/ui` components across login/dashboard.
- **Reversibility**: While the core framework choice is foundational, individual design system choices or components can be iterated. If `shadcn/ui` proves unsuitable, a pivot to another UI library would be a significant but possible change (though not easily reversible in the short term). The experiment focuses on *establishing* the system, not a reversible feature.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized with `shadcn/ui` integrated.
- [ ] Google login screen implemented and functional.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page with mock content created.
- [ ] Foundational design system (component usage, theming) established using `shadcn/ui` primitives.
- [ ] Initial setup completed within 5 working days.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (N/A for core app foundation, but ensure modularity for future features).
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (initial design intent will be minimal).
- [ ] Tests written (basic UI component tests, login flow tests).
- [ ] Documentation updated (initial README, setup guide).
- [ ] QA validation passed (manual validation of login/dashboard).
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for initial app, but for features built upon it).
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (time tracking for setup).

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Time taken for initial setup, qualitative assessment of UI consistency and developer experience.
- **Target**: Initial setup within 5 days. High developer satisfaction with `shadcn/ui` for rapid component assembly.
- **Measured via**: Time tracking, developer feedback, qualitative UI review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 1-2 weeks of initial development using this foundation.
- **If successful**: Update belief to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md that `shadcn/ui` provides an effective and fast UI foundation.
- **If unsuccessful**: Document learnings in product/beliefs/history.md and re-evaluate UI framework strategy.
