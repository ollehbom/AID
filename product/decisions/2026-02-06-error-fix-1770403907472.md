## Overview
This decision outlines the foundational work to establish a basic React application, incorporating a modern design system and essential user authentication, to enable subsequent product experimentation and validation.

## Hypothesis
As a founder,
I believe having a foundational React application with a modern design system, Google login, and a basic dashboard
Will result in faster validation of core product value propositions
Because it provides the essential platform for interaction and early user feedback.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: This foundational work supports the implicit belief that a functional application is necessary to test our 'Open / Unproven' beliefs regarding onboarding and core features.
- **Current Workflow**: Currently, there is no deployable application. All feedback is theoretical.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a tangible product prevents real user interaction and validation of core hypotheses.
- **Success Metric**: A deployable React application with the specified components (shadcn UI, Google login, mock dashboard, initial design system) is available.
- **Reversibility**: While foundational, the modular nature of React and shadcn UI components allows for flexibility in future design iterations. The core app itself is the 'experiment' here.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React application initialized and configured with shadcn/ui.
- [ ] Login screen implemented with Google OAuth functionality.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page with mock content created as the starting view.
- [ ] An initial design system structure defined and applied across components.
- [ ] Application is deployable.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] React project scaffolding complete.
- [ ] shadcn/ui integrated and styled components used.
- [ ] Google login flow implemented and tested.
- [ ] Basic dashboard layout and mock components in place.
- [ ] Initial design system components (e.g., typography, color palette) defined and used.
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (as interpreted by Design Agent).
- [ ] Tests written for critical components (e.g., login).
- [ ] Documentation for setup and deployment updated.
- [ ] QA validation passed for core functionality.
- [ ] Application deployed to a staging environment.

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Availability of a deployable, functional React application meeting the specified requirements.
- **Target**: Application is deployed and accessible, ready for the Design Agent to refine and for subsequent user feedback.
- **Measured via**: Manual verification of deployment and functionality.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of this GitHub issue.
- **If successful**: Proceed to the Design Agent stage for UI/UX refinement and prepare for user testing of 'Open / Unproven' beliefs.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate technical approach and scope.

## Dependencies
- Blocked by: N/A
