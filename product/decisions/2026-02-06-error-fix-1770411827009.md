## Decision Record: error-fix-1770411827009 - Foundational React App & Design System

### Overview
This decision outlines the plan to establish a foundational React application using shadcn/ui, integrating Google authentication, and providing a basic dashboard. This serves as the initial user interface and establishes a consistent design system for future product development.

### Hypothesis
As a technically competent user, I believe a modern, intuitive React application with a consistent design system and basic authentication will provide a solid foundation for product interaction. This will result in faster iteration on future features and a positive initial user experience, enabling us to validate core product beliefs. This is because a strong foundational UI/UX reduces friction for both users and developers.

### Context
- **Affected Beliefs**: This foundational work is critical to enable the testing and validation of our core beliefs: "The product must feel obvious without documentation", "Users value speed over configurability", and "The primary user is technically competent". It also introduces a new implicit belief: "A modern, consistent UI foundation enables faster iteration and positive initial user experience."
- **Current Workflow**: Currently, there is no interactive user interface for the product.
- **Pain Point**: Inability to provide users with an interactive product, hindering initial user engagement and the ability to gather feedback on user experience.
- **Success Metric**: Successful deployment of the basic application, functional Google login, and a rendered dashboard page with mock content. Initial developer velocity on subsequent UI tasks.
- **Reversibility**: While the core framework choice (React, shadcn/ui) is a significant architectural decision not easily reversible, specific UI components, flows, and features built upon this foundation can be iterated, modified, or removed as experiments.

### Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `medium` (4-7 days estimated effort)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

### Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Successful deployment of the React application, 100% functional Google login, dashboard page renders with mock content.
- **Target**: Achieve full functionality for the specified core components.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, developer feedback, basic application logging.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of the initial build, estimated within 7 days.
- **If successful**: The belief that "A modern, consistent UI foundation enables faster iteration and positive initial user experience" will be strengthened, providing a solid platform for future experiments.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen framework, design system, or implementation approach to identify bottlenecks.

### Learning Integration
This foundational experiment will provide the platform for all subsequent UI/UX experiments. Learnings will primarily inform the "Open / Unproven" beliefs once actual user-facing features are built and tested. Success will validate the decision to invest in this modern UI foundation.
