## Overview

Establish the foundational React application with a modern design system, Google login, and a basic dashboard to enable initial user onboarding and provide a consistent platform for future feature validation.

## Hypothesis

As a technically competent primary user,
I believe a well-structured React app with a modern design system and Google login
Will enable me to easily access and navigate the product's initial interface, resulting in a smooth onboarding experience and a consistent platform for future interactions
Because the product should feel obvious without documentation.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (Core), "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" (Open/Unproven).
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application for users to log into or interact with.
- **Pain Point**: Inability to onboard initial users or test any product features due to the lack of basic application infrastructure.
- **Success Metric**: Successful Google logins by test users, intuitive navigation to the basic dashboard.
- **Reversibility**: The foundational framework itself is a strategic commitment, but specific design choices, component implementations, or authentication providers can be iterated on or swapped in future experiments.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `epic` (requires breaking down into sub-issues)
- **Component**: `frontend`, `backend` (for authentication)
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**:
    - Percentage of successful Google logins for internal test users.
    - Qualitative feedback on the intuitiveness of the login flow and dashboard navigation.
    - Developer velocity for subsequent UI tasks (tracked over time).
- **Target**:
    - >95% successful Google logins for the first 10 internal test users.
    - Zero reported issues by test users regarding login or dashboard navigation.
    - Positive feedback on the utility and consistency of the design system by developers.
- **Measured via**: Internal testing, basic authentication logs, developer surveys.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 2 weeks post-initial deployment.
- **If successful**: Update "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" towards "Validated" or "Core" based on further user testing. Confirm that the design system accelerates development and maintains UI consistency.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen authentication method, the initial dashboard structure, or the design system choice based on specific points of failure. Document learnings in product/beliefs/history.md.
