## Overview

Decision to establish the initial product frontend foundation including a React app with Shadcn UI, Google login, and a basic dashboard, alongside the implementation of a foundational design system.

## Hypothesis

As a `technical founder / early adopter`
I believe `establishing a modern React app with Shadcn UI, Google login, and a basic dashboard`
Will result in `a robust, intuitive, and visually consistent product foundation`
Because `it aligns with modern web standards and ensures a smooth initial user experience, supporting the belief that the product must feel obvious without documentation.`

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This effort reinforces the "The product must feel obvious without documentation" belief by establishing a modern and consistent UI foundation.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no current frontend application or user login.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a functional user interface and authentication mechanism prevents early engagement and testing of core product ideas.
- **Success Metric**: Successful deployment of the React app, functional Google login, and accessible dashboard with consistent Shadcn styling.
- **Reversibility**: While core application structure is foundational, specific UI components and styling choices can be iteratively updated or swapped. Authentication methods can be extended or modified.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**:
    - Successful Google login completion rate (target 100% for initial tests).
    - Dashboard loads without errors.
    - Consistency of UI elements across login and dashboard pages.
- **Target**: Initial deployment is functional and stable.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, developer console checks.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon initial deployment (within 1-2 weeks of development completion).
- **If successful**: The foundational UI and authentication are established, paving the way for feature development.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate choice of UI framework, authentication provider, or application architecture.
