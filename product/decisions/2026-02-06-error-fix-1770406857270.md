## Overview

Experiment to establish the foundational UI/UX of the product by creating a React application styled with `shadcn/ui`, including a Google login screen and a basic dashboard. This is a critical first step to establish the product's UI/UX framework.

## Hypothesis

As a technical user, I believe that establishing a modern React application with a consistent `shadcn/ui` design system, a functional Google login, and a basic dashboard will provide a strong, consistent foundation, resulting in faster future UI development and a polished user experience because a well-architected UI framework is essential for developer efficiency and user adoption.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This work supports the implicit belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and "Users value speed over configurability" by providing a solid, intuitive UI foundation. While not directly validating or challenging an existing explicit belief, it's foundational for future belief testing.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application or UI framework. Development would currently be ad-hoc.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a standardized, modern UI foundation and design system, leading to inconsistent user experience and slower development of future features.
- **Success Metric**: Developer velocity (time taken to implement new UI features), UI consistency across the application, and positive internal feedback on the design system's usability.
- **Reversibility**: The choice of React and `shadcn/ui` represents a significant architectural decision. While individual components or styling can be modified, a full reversal of the core tech stack would be a major undertaking. The experiment focuses on the *initial establishment* and *adoption* of this foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application scaffolded and running locally.
- [ ] `shadcn/ui` integrated and basic components (e.g., Button, Input) are functional.
- [ ] Login screen implemented with Google OAuth integration.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page created with mock content, accessible after login.
- [ ] Core design system principles (typography, color palette, spacing) are documented and applied via `shadcn/ui` customization.
- [ ] Success metrics baseline captured (e.g., initial developer feedback, time for a small UI task).

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured for any experimental UI elements (if applicable, though foundational).
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (from Design Agent).
- [ ] Tests written for core components and login flow (≥85% coverage).
- [ ] Documentation updated for setting up the frontend, using the design system, and authentication.
- [ ] QA validation passed for login and dashboard functionality.
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for foundational internal work, but for future features).
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (as per Acceptance Criteria).

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**:
    - **Developer Velocity**: Time taken to implement subsequent UI features using the established design system.
    - **UI Consistency**: Number of unique UI patterns/components introduced outside of the `shadcn/ui` framework.
    - **Internal Adoption**: Feedback from developers on the ease of using the design system.
- **Target**:
    - Reduce time for new UI feature development by 20% within the first month compared to ad-hoc styling.
    - 90% of new UI components utilize `shadcn/ui` components or extensions thereof.
    - Achieve an average developer satisfaction score of 4/5 or higher regarding the design system.
- **Measured via**: Developer surveys, code reviews, time tracking for specific UI tasks.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 2 development sprints (approx. 4 weeks) of subsequent feature development.
- **If successful**: Update belief to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md: "A modern, consistent UI foundation significantly accelerates development and enhances user perception."
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in `product/beliefs/history.md` and document learnings, re-evaluate the chosen framework or implementation strategy.
