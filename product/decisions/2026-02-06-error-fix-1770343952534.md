# Product Decision: error-fix-1770343952534 - Establish Core React Application## OverviewThis decision outlines the foundational work to establish a React application styled with shadcn/ui, including a Google login screen and a basic dashboard with mock content. This is a crucial step to create a modern and efficient development environment for future product iterations.## HypothesisAs a product team,I believe establishing a React application with shadcn/ui, Google login, and a basic dashboardWill result in a rapid and consistent development environment that enables quick validation of core user needs in subsequent experimentsBecause it provides a modern, opinionated foundation for efficient feature delivery and UI consistency.## Context- **Affected Belief**: This foundational work supports the existing beliefs: "Users value speed over configurability" (by providing a streamlined UI framework) and "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (by enabling a consistent and intuitive design system). It does not directly validate or invalidate them but is a prerequisite for future validation.- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application. Development starts from scratch.- **Pain Point**: Lack of a functional platform to build upon and test user-centric features.- **Success Metric**: Successful deployment of the core application, functional authentication, and readiness for subsequent feature development.- **Reversibility**: While the core technology stack choice is foundational, individual components and features built on this foundation can be managed with feature flags or easily modified. The design system integration itself is a core choice for the product's aesthetic and development efficiency.## Experiment Scope- **Size**: `size: medium`- **Component**: `frontend`- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`## Success Evaluation- **Metric**: Functional React application, integrated shadcn/ui, working Google login, accessible basic dashboard with mock content. Qualitative assessment of developer velocity and ease of UI development.- **Target**: The application is successfully deployed and stable, providing a ready platform for the Design Agent and subsequent feature development.- **Measured via**: Manual verification, developer feedback.- **Timeline**: Evaluate initial setup and stability after 7 days of development.- **If successful**: Proceed with building out specific user-facing features on this foundation, leveraging the established design system.- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen technology stack (React, shadcn/ui) or authentication method if significant blockers or inefficiencies are encountered.## Related Documentation- Experiment tracking: `experiments/active.md`- Design intent: `design/intents/error-fix-1770343952534.md` (to be created by Design Agent)
