## Overview
Establish the foundational UI/UX of the product using React and Shadcn components, including Google login and a basic dashboard, to validate our approach to user interface and development speed.

## Hypothesis
As a technically competent user,
I believe a modern, component-based UI (using Shadcn) with a clear Google login and a basic dashboard
Will provide an intuitive and fast-to-implement foundation, resulting in a positive initial user experience and faster development
Because it aligns with modern design standards and allows for rapid iteration, validating our belief that users value speed and intuitiveness.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: `product/beliefs/current.md` (Core: "The product must feel obvious without documentation", "Users value speed over configurability", "The primary user is technically competent")
- **Current Workflow**: No existing user interface. Users cannot visually interact with the product.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a visual, interactive entry point for the application, hindering initial user engagement and feature development.
- **Success Metric**: Positive qualitative feedback from founders/early users on intuitiveness and aesthetic, successful completion of Google login flow, functional dashboard display, developer satisfaction with design system reusability.
- **Reversibility**: While the choice of React/Shadcn is foundational, specific UI components can be swapped, and the codebase can be refactored or replaced if the approach proves fundamentally flawed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React app initialized with Shadcn components.
- [ ] Google login implemented and functional.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page with mock content displayed.
- [ ] Initial design system principles documented (e.g., theme, typography, color palette).
- [ ] Qualitative feedback gathered from founders/early users on initial experience.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature flag configured (N/A for foundational UI, but conceptually tied to a 'soft launch' or internal dev environment)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (as defined by initial design system principles)
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage for core components/flows)
- [ ] Documentation updated (initial design system, setup instructions)
- [ ] QA validation passed (basic functionality, responsiveness)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (internal demo for founder/early users)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (initial qualitative feedback)

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Qualitative feedback on intuitiveness, aesthetic, and developer velocity for future UI tasks.
- **Target**: High satisfaction from founders/early users regarding the UI foundation, and a clear path for rapid subsequent UI feature development.
- **Measured via**: Founder interviews, internal developer feedback, informal user testing.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 1 week of initial build completion.
- **If successful**: Update belief to "Shadcn-based UI provides intuitive experience and rapid development" to Core in `product/beliefs/current.md`.
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in `product/beliefs/history.md` and document learnings, re-evaluate UI framework/design system approach.
