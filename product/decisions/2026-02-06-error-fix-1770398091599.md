## Overview

Decision to establish the foundational user interface for the product, including a React application styled with shadcn/ui, a Google login screen, and a basic dashboard with mock content. This also involves implementing a core design system.

## Hypothesis

As a new user,
I believe a modern, consistent UI built with React and shadcn/ui, featuring Google login and a basic dashboard,
Will provide a clear and intuitive starting point for interacting with the product,
Because it aligns with modern web standards, reduces cognitive load, and enables rapid future development that reinforces our core beliefs about user experience.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This experiment reinforces "The primary user is technically competent" by using a modern, developer-friendly stack and "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by establishing a consistent and intuitive design foundation.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application UI. This is the initial setup.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a foundational user interface and consistent design system to build upon.
- **Success Metric**: Successful user authentication via Google, consistent application of shadcn/ui components, and a functional basic dashboard.
- **Reversibility**: The specific content of the dashboard and individual UI components can be easily iterated or changed. The choice of React/shadcn is foundational, but the initial implementation is minimal, allowing for future adjustments to the design system itself.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core React application initialized and running.
- [ ] shadcn/ui integrated and basic components demonstrated.
- [ ] Google login functionality implemented and tested successfully.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page rendering with mock content.
- [ ] Initial design system principles documented (e.g., component usage guidelines).

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable for specific features, but this is core).
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (to be provided by Design Agent).
- [ ] Tests written (e.g., for login flow, component rendering).
- [ ] Documentation updated (e.g., README for setup, basic design system overview).
- [ ] QA validation passed (basic functionality).
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for foundational MVP).
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A for initial implementation, but future metrics will build on this).

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Successful Google logins, consistent shadcn/ui adoption across initial components, functional dashboard display.
- **Target**: 100% successful Google logins in testing; 100% of initial UI components using shadcn/ui; dashboard renders without errors.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, developer review, basic analytics for login success (post-deployment).
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days of development and initial testing.
- **If successful**: Continue building subsequent features on this foundation, validating that it facilitates rapid development and an intuitive user experience.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate choice of UI framework or authentication method, document learnings in product/beliefs/history.md.

## Dependencies

- Blocked by: N/A
