## Product Decision: Establish Foundational UI and Design System

### Overview

This decision outlines the plan to implement the foundational React application, integrating shadcn/ui for a modern design system, a functional Google login screen, and a basic dashboard.

### Hypothesis

As a technically competent user, I believe a modern React application built with shadcn/ui, including a functional Google login and a basic dashboard, will create an obvious and consistent user experience, resulting in faster comprehension and interaction with the product because the product must feel obvious without documentation.

### Context

- **Affected Belief**: product/beliefs/current.md#core-the-product-must-feel-obvious-without-documentation
- **Current Workflow**: No existing UI or application foundation.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a consistent, modern front-end foundation delays feature development and user interaction, hindering the ability to deliver an "obvious" product from the outset.
- **Success Metric**: Functional Google login, accessible dashboard, initial design system components defined and used, positive internal developer feedback on design system usability.
- **Reversibility**: Individual UI components can be refactored or replaced. The choice of React/shadcn/ui is foundational and less reversible without significant re-architecture, but the experiment focuses on establishing this initial foundation.

### Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (for initial setup, with potential for further breakdown by Design Agent)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

### Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: User authentication success rate, dashboard accessibility, internal developer adoption/satisfaction with design system.
- **Target**: 100% functional login and dashboard, positive developer feedback on the ease of using the design system for new components.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, internal developer surveys/feedback.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 2 weeks of initial deployment/internal use.
- **If successful**: This will implicitly strengthen the core belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by demonstrating a strong foundational UI. Learnings will be integrated into future design system iterations.
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in product/beliefs/history.md and document learnings (e.g., if shadcn/ui proves unsuitable or the login flow is confusing).

### Dependencies

- **Blocked by**: None
- **Blocks**: All future UI features and user-facing development.
