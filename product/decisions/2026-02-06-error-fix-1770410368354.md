## Overview

Establish the foundational React application, incorporating a modern design system with Shadcn UI, Google authentication, and a basic dashboard to serve as the initial user entry point.

## Hypothesis

As a technically competent user
I believe a modern React application with Google login and a basic dashboard, built on a well-defined design system
Will result in an obvious and intuitive initial experience, allowing them to access the application and view content without friction
Because it aligns with our core beliefs about user experience and sets a robust foundation.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: The product must feel obvious without documentation; Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance (from product/beliefs/current.md)
- **Current Workflow**: N/A - no functional application exists yet.
- **Pain Point**: N/A - This is a foundational build addressing the need for a modern, functional application, not an existing user pain point.
- **Success Metric**: Successful Google login and basic dashboard access by internal testers.
- **Reversibility**: Partial reversibility for individual components and design choices; core application setup is foundational but can be refactored.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Experiment implemented behind feature flag (for components or staged deployment)
- [ ] Success metric tracked: number of successful Google logins, dashboard load times, design system component reusability.
- [ ] Rollback plan tested (for individual components/deployments).
- [ ] Results evaluated after 7 days of internal testing.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (or equivalent for initial deployment)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage for core components)
- [ ] Documentation updated (for design system, setup)
- [ ] QA validation passed (internal testing)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (for internal release)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (initial login/dashboard access rates)

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Percentage of successful Google logins; Dashboard load time; Design system component reusability.
- **Target**: 100% successful Google logins by internal testers; Dashboard loads under 2 seconds; Core design system components are available and used for login/dashboard.
- **Measured via**: Internal testing, browser developer tools, basic logging.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days of internal testing.
- **If successful**: Update belief to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md (for "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" if initial experience proves it).
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in product/beliefs/history.md and document learnings.
