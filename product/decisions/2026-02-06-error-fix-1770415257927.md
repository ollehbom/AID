## Overview

This decision addresses the founder's directive to establish the core frontend application. It involves setting up a React application, integrating the Shadcn UI component library, implementing Google login for user authentication, and creating a basic dashboard as the initial user interface. This foundational work will enable subsequent feature development and belief validation.

## Hypothesis

As a new user, I believe that a simple Google login and a clear, basic dashboard will allow me to access the application efficiently, which will result in a smooth initial interaction and readiness for core product features because it provides a familiar and intuitive entry point.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This foundational work supports and enables future testing of "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" by providing the necessary UI canvas.
- **Current Workflow**: N/A (there is no existing application frontend or user workflow to reference).
- **Pain Point**: The current lack of a functional application frontend, a user authentication system, and a consistent UI foundation prevents any further product development or user interaction.
- **Success Metric**: 100% successful Google login and redirection to the dashboard; all basic Shadcn components are correctly integrated and render as expected; initial design system definitions are applied consistently.
- **Reversibility**: The core technical stack (React, Shadcn) and foundational setup are not easily reversible without significant re-architecture. However, specific UI implementations or alternative login providers can be swapped or modified in future iterations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React app initialized and running locally.
- [ ] Shadcn UI components integrated and a basic component (e.g., Button, Input) renders correctly.
- [ ] Google OAuth login flow implemented and functional, allowing users to authenticate.
- [ ] Users are successfully redirected to a basic dashboard after a successful login.
- [ ] The basic dashboard displays mock content (e.g., placeholder cards, text).
- [ ] Initial design system variables (e.g., primary colors, font families, spacing tokens) are defined and applied across the login and dashboard screens.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable for specific features, though core setup typically isn't flagged).
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec.
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage for core components/logic).
- [ ] Documentation updated (e.g., README for setup, component usage).
- [ ] QA validation passed (manual verification of login, dashboard, component rendering).
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for initial internal build).
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A for foundational setup, as it's about existence not improvement).

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Functional Google login, error-free dashboard rendering, successful integration of Shadcn components and initial design system.
- **Target**: 100% functionality and successful integration of all specified components.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing and developer verification.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days of development completion.
- **If successful**: The product will have a stable, modern frontend foundation, accelerating subsequent feature development and enabling future user belief validation experiments.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen technical stack, design system approach, or implementation strategy to address identified issues.

## Dependencies

- Blocked by: N/A
- Blocks: All subsequent frontend feature development and user-facing experiments.
- Related belief: N/A (supports general product principles rather than specific belief validation at this stage).
