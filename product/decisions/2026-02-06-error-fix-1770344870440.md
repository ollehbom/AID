## Overview

This experiment aims to establish the foundational React application, styled with shadcn UI, including a Google login screen and a basic dashboard, to enable rapid future development.

## Hypothesis

As a technical user starting with the product
I believe that a modern React application foundation built with shadcn UI, a consistent design system, and core features like Google login and a basic dashboard
Will result in enabling rapid future feature development and providing an intuitive initial user experience
Because establishing a strong, modern technical and visual base is critical for an early-stage product targeting technically competent users.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This foundational work underpins core beliefs such as "Users value speed over configurability" and "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by creating the environment where they can be tested. It doesn't directly validate or challenge an existing specific belief but establishes the platform.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application foundation. Development is blocked on establishing this base.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a basic, functional application structure and visual language to build upon, hindering initial product development and user interaction.
- **Success Metric**: Successful implementation and deployment of the React app with shadcn styling, functional Google login, and a rendering basic dashboard.
- **Reversibility**: While foundational changes are not easily "reversed" in the traditional sense, the modularity of React and shadcn allows for refactoring or component replacement if initial choices prove suboptimal. The core "experiment" here is the chosen tech stack for the foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application successfully initialized and running
- [ ] shadcn UI library integrated and basic components styled
- [ ] Google login screen implemented and functional
- [ ] Basic dashboard page renders with mock content
- [ ] Initial design system components (colors, typography, spacing) defined using shadcn primitives
- [ ] Rollback plan (e.g., ability to revert to previous commit if setup fails catastrophically) documented.
- [ ] Results evaluated upon completion of implementation.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (N/A for foundational setup, but framework should allow it)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (design spec to be created by Design Agent)
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage for core components)
- [ ] Documentation updated (README, setup instructions)
- [ ] QA validation passed (functional login, dashboard render, basic styling)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for foundational MVP, it's a single release)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A, this is about existence, not a metric change)

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Existence and functionality of the core React app, shadcn integration, Google login, and basic dashboard.
- **Target**: 100% completion of specified foundational elements.
- **Measured via**: Manual verification and automated tests.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days from start of implementation.
- **If successful**: The foundation is established, allowing further feature development. Update belief to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md (implicitly, that this tech stack is viable).
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate chosen tech stack or approach for initial application setup. Archive learnings in product/beliefs/history.md.

## Dependencies

- Blocked by: None (initial setup)
- Blocks: All subsequent frontend feature development
- Related belief: Foundational enabler for all core beliefs.
