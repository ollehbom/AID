## Overview\n\nThis decision outlines the foundational work to create a new React application, integrating a modern design system (shadcn/ui), Google authentication, and a basic dashboard as the initial user interface.\n\n## Hypothesis\n\nAs a **new user**,\nI believe **a React application built with shadcn/ui, featuring Google login and a basic dashboard**,\nWill result in **an intuitive and modern user experience, and accelerate subsequent product development**,\nBecause **it establishes a consistent, user-friendly interface foundation that supports the core belief of an obvious product.**\n\n## Context\n\n- **Affected Belief**: `product/beliefs/current.md` -> "The product must feel obvious without documentation." (Reinforced by establishing a clean UI foundation).\n- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application or workflow; this is foundational setup.\n- **Pain Point**: Lack of a functional and styled application to begin building and validating product concepts.\n- **Success Metric**: The application is deployable, Google login is functional, and the basic dashboard renders correctly with integrated shadcn/ui components.\n- **Reversibility**: While core framework choices are not easily reversible, the specific implementation of UI components or authentication methods can be iterated upon. The experiment focuses on establishing *a* foundation, not necessarily *the only* foundation.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] React application initialized and configured.\n- [ ] shadcn/ui integrated as the primary styling framework.\n- [ ] Login screen implemented with Google OAuth functionality.\n- [ ] Basic dashboard page renders with mock content post-authentication.\n- [ ] Core design system components (buttons, inputs, etc.) are available and styled.\n\n## Experiment Scope\n\n- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)\n- **Component**: `frontend`\n- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable for parts like new components, but not for the core app setup)\n- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (once design agent provides it)\n- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage for core components)\n- [ ] Documentation updated (initial setup guide)\n- [ ] QA validation passed (functional login, dashboard rendering)\n- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for initial app setup, but for future features)\n- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A, as this is baseline creation)\n\n## Success Evaluation\n\n- **Metric**: Functional deployment and operation of specified components.\n- **Target**: 100% functionality of React app, shadcn/ui styling, Google login, and basic dashboard.\n- **Measured via**: Manual testing and developer verification.\n- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days of development.\n- **If successful**: Update belief to reflect that a modern, opinionated UI framework (like shadcn/ui) contributes significantly to intuitiveness and accelerates initial development.\n- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate framework choice or approach, document learnings in `product/beliefs/history.md`.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Blocked by: N/A\n- Blocks: Subsequent feature development.\n- Related belief: "The product must feel obvious without documentation."\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- Experiment tracking: `experiments/active.md`\n- Design intent: `design/intents/error-fix-1770345349563.md` (created by Design Agent)
