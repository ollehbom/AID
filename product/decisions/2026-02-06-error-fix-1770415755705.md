## Overview

Establish the foundational UI for the product with a React application, integrated Shadcn UI, a login screen with Google authentication, and a basic dashboard, setting up a robust design system.

## Hypothesis

As a new user/developer interacting with the initial product,
I believe a foundational React application styled with Shadcn UI, including a login screen and basic dashboard,
Will result in a rapid development cycle for subsequent features and a consistent, modern user experience,
Because establishing a robust design system early aligns with the belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and allows for faster iteration on user-facing experiments.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: The product must feel obvious without documentation (Core belief)
- **Current Workflow**: There is no current UI workflow; this is the initial build.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a consistent, modern, and functional UI foundation for the product.
- **Success Metric**: Successful deployment of the basic app, presence of requested components, and adherence to Shadcn styling and design system principles.
- **Reversibility**: The choice of Shadcn UI and React is a foundational decision. While individual components can be swapped, the overall framework is a core choice. For this initial experiment, reversibility is limited to the specific features (login, dashboard content) rather than the tech stack.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and deployable
- [ ] Shadcn UI integrated and basic components used
- [ ] Login screen implemented with Google authentication
- [ ] Basic dashboard page rendered with mock content
- [ ] A basic design system structure or guidelines established (e.g., theme provider, utility classes, component library setup)

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (N/A for foundational app)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec
- [ ] Tests written (unit/integration for core components)
- [ ] Documentation updated (initial setup guide, component usage)
- [ ] QA validation passed (basic functionality, responsiveness)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A)

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Presence of functional login, dashboard, and Shadcn UI integration. Adherence to established design system guidelines.
- **Target**: 100% completion of requested components, visually consistent with Shadcn UI.
- **Measured via**: Manual review and functional testing.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after initial deployment (e.g., 7 days from start).
- **If successful**: The UI foundation is established, allowing for subsequent feature development. No direct belief update, but solidifies the platform for future belief validation.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen tech stack (React/Shadcn) or scope of the initial build.
