## Overview

Decision to establish the foundational React application, including a login system and a basic dashboard, and to implement a modern design system based on shadcn/ui. This sets the stage for future feature development and user experience validation.

## Hypothesis

As a new user, I believe a functional Google login and a basic, consistent dashboard built with a modern design system (shadcn) will provide an intuitive and obvious entry point to the product, enabling early feature development and validating the 'product must feel obvious without documentation' belief.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: The product must feel obvious without documentation (Core belief)
- **Current Workflow**: There is no current application or user workflow. This experiment establishes the initial platform.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a foundational application structure and consistent UI/UX to build upon and test future hypotheses.
- **Success Metric**: User can successfully log in via Google; a basic dashboard renders without errors; core design system components are available and reusable by developers.
- **Reversibility**: Individual UI components can be modified or replaced. The chosen login method can be swapped in the future. The design system can evolve. This foundational layer is designed to be extensible rather than easily reversible in its entirety, but its components are modular.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and running.
- [ ] Google login functionality implemented and tested.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page with mock content renders successfully.
- [ ] shadcn/ui integrated and a foundational design system established with at least 3 reusable components (e.g., Button, Card, Input).
- [ ] Basic routing for login and dashboard pages.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag for specific dashboard elements (if any) configured (optional for this foundational stage).
- [ ] Code implemented per initial architectural vision.
- [ ] Tests written for login and core component rendering.
- [ ] Basic documentation for design system usage.
- [ ] QA validation passed for login and dashboard display.
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (e.g., initial developer feedback on design system usability).

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**:
    - % of successful Google logins.
    - Time to load dashboard.
    - Developer adoption/satisfaction with design system components.
- **Target**:
    - 100% login success for test users.
    - Dashboard loads in <1 second.
    - Positive internal feedback on design system reusability.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, network performance tools, internal developer survey/feedback.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 2 weeks of initial implementation.
- **If successful**: This foundational layer is robust and supports further development. Update belief to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md regarding the ease of entry and consistency provided by this setup.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate choice of framework/design system, or simplify the initial application even further. Archive learnings in product/beliefs/history.md.
