## Overview

This decision outlines the foundational work to establish a new React application with a modern design system using shadcn/ui, including a login screen and a basic dashboard, to enable rapid and consistent future feature development.

## Hypothesis

As a **product team (and ultimately end-users)**
I believe **implementing a shadcn/ui-based React application with a defined design system, a Google login, and a basic dashboard**
Will result in **a robust, consistent, and extensible UI foundation, enabling faster iteration on user-facing features and improving perceived product quality**
Because **a strong visual and functional foundation is critical for early-stage product success and efficient development.**

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This decision supports and expands upon the core belief "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by providing a consistent UI. It also establishes a new foundational belief regarding UI/UX infrastructure.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing React application or defined design system. Development would be ad-hoc, inconsistent, and slow.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a cohesive, modern UI foundation will lead to inconsistent user experiences, slower development cycles, and increased technical debt as features are added without a guiding system.
- **Success Metric**: 
    - Existence of a functional React application with shadcn/ui.
    - Working Google login.
    - Basic dashboard with mock content.
    - Initial design system components and tokens defined and documented.
    - Positive developer feedback on the ease of using the design system for new components.
- **Reversibility**: While the choice of UI framework (shadcn/ui) is a significant architectural decision, the modular nature of React components and design tokens allows for adaptation. The initial implementation will focus on core components, minimizing deep dependencies that are hard to undo. Changes to the design system can be iterated.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and styled with shadcn/ui.
- [ ] Google login integrated and functional.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page rendering mock content.
- [ ] Core design system components (e.g., buttons, inputs, typography, color palette) defined and implemented.
- [ ] Documentation for the initial design system structure.
- [ ] Consistency of UI elements across login and dashboard screens.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] React app scaffolding complete.
- [ ] shadcn/ui integrated and configured.
- [ ] Google OAuth setup and functional for login.
- [ ] Dashboard route and basic UI structure implemented.
- [ ] Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) defined.
- [ ] Core UI components (e.g., Button, Input, Card) implemented using shadcn/ui and design tokens.
- [ ] Basic internal documentation for the design system.
- [ ] Initial QA validation passed (functional login, dashboard rendering).
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics captured for initial load.

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**:
    1.  Successful implementation and functionality of the requested core components (React app, shadcn/ui, Google login, basic dashboard).
    2.  Definition and initial documentation of the design system.
    3.  Positive feedback from initial developers regarding the usability and consistency provided by the design system.
- **Target**: 100% of specified components functional, design system documented, and development team confirms improved consistency and foundation.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, code review, internal developer survey/feedback.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 2 weeks post-implementation.
- **If successful**: Update belief to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md: "A modern, consistent design system (e.g., shadcn/ui based) is essential for rapid, high-quality UI development and positive user experience."
- **If unsuccessful**: Document specific issues in product/beliefs/history.md and reassess the UI framework/design system strategy.
