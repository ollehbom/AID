## Overview
Establish a foundational React application using `shadcn/ui` and a modern design system to provide a robust, extensible, and intuitive UI for the product.

## Hypothesis
As a technical user (and founder),
I believe establishing a modern React application with `shadcn/ui` and a well-defined design system
Will result in a fast, intuitive, and extensible UI foundation that accelerates future feature development
Because it aligns with our core beliefs of speed, technical competence, and intuitive design, enabling rapid iteration and a consistent user experience.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: This initiative directly supports our core beliefs: "Users value speed over configurability", "The primary user is technically competent", and "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (referenced from `product/beliefs/current.md`).
- **Current Workflow**: Currently, there is no established modern UI framework or comprehensive design system. Future UI development risks inconsistency and slower iteration without a clear foundation.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a consistent and extensible UI foundation that can support rapid feature development and ensure a unified user experience.
- **Success Metric**: A functional React application with specified features (login, dashboard), initial design system components clearly defined and documented, and positive developer feedback on ease of extension and adherence to modern standards.
- **Reversibility**: While the core technology choice (React, shadcn/ui) is significant and not easily reversible in its entirety, the *implementation* of the design system and individual components can be iterated upon. A rollback plan would involve reverting the codebase to a state prior to this foundational work if the initial setup proves critically flawed.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: medium (4-7 days)
- **Component**: frontend
- **Phase**: phase-1-mvp

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Functional application, documented design system components, positive developer feedback on extensibility and ease of use.
- **Target**: 100% of specified features (login, dashboard) implemented; initial design system components clearly defined and accessible; high developer satisfaction with the new UI foundation.
- **Measured via**: QA testing, code review, internal developer surveys/feedback.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 1-2 weeks post-initial implementation.
- **If successful**: The established UI foundation will be considered the new standard for frontend development, reinforcing our core beliefs.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the choice of framework/design system, or re-scope the initial implementation to address identified issues.
