## Overview

Decision to establish the foundational user interface for the product by implementing a React application styled with Shadcn UI, including Google login and a basic dashboard. This will also involve designing and implementing a core design system.

## Hypothesis

As a technical user
I believe a modern React UI built with Shadcn, featuring Google login and a basic dashboard, will create an intuitive and fast-to-develop frontend foundation
Will result in enabling rapid iteration and future feature development that feels obvious to users
Because this approach aligns with our beliefs about speed, intuitiveness, and our target user's technical competence.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: "The product must feel obvious without documentation", "Users value speed over configurability", "The primary user is technically competent".
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing frontend UI.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a consistent, modern, and functional user interface foundation prevents further product development and validation.
- **Success Metric**: Functional Google login, a basic dashboard displaying mock content, and the successful implementation of core design system components, leading to faster UI development for subsequent features.
- **Reversibility**: While adopting Shadcn is a significant framework choice, individual UI components and the overall application structure can be refactored or replaced if the approach proves unsuitable. The experiment tests the initial implementation and developer experience.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: 
    - Successful Google authentication and redirection to the dashboard.
    - Consistency of styling across implemented components (login, dashboard).
    - Qualitative feedback from developers on the ease of using the design system.
- **Target**: 100% functional login/dashboard, consistent UI aesthetics, positive developer feedback.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, visual inspection, developer interviews/surveys.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after initial implementation and a short period of developer usage (e.g., 2 weeks).
- **If successful**: Update belief to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md regarding the chosen UI stack's effectiveness for rapid development and intuitiveness.
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in product/beliefs/history.md and document learnings, potentially exploring alternative UI frameworks or design system approaches.
