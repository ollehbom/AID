## Overview
Establish core React UI with Shadcn, Google login, and a basic dashboard to provide a foundation for future feature development and user interaction testing.

## Hypothesis
As a technical founder
I believe that establishing a minimal, modern UI foundation with a consistent design system (using Shadcn UI) and basic authentication (Google Login)
Will enable rapid iteration and validation of core user workflows, leading to an intuitive user experience without requiring extensive documentation
Because we need a functional base to build upon and test our core beliefs.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: This experiment lays the groundwork to validate "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and "Users value speed over configurability".
- **Current Workflow**: No existing user interface.
- **Pain Point**: Inability to test user-facing features or gather user feedback due to the lack of a functional application.
- **Success Metric**: Fully functional login and dashboard components; consistent application of Shadcn UI principles for initial components.
- **Reversibility**: While the UI foundation itself is mandatory, the specific choice of Shadcn UI could be revisited if it proves unsuitable (though this would be a significant refactor).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React app initialized with Shadcn UI.
- [ ] Google login implemented and functional.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page accessible after login, displaying mock content.
- [ ] Initial UI components adhere to Shadcn styling and design system principles.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable for specific components)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] QA validation passed
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for initial foundational release)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A for foundational UI)

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Functionality and visual consistency of core UI components.
- **Target**: 100% functional login and dashboard; 100% adherence to design system for implemented components.
- **Measured via**: Manual QA and visual inspection.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of the `medium` sized task.
- **If successful**: Confirms the chosen tech stack and design system are effective for rapid development and intuitive UX. Continue building.
- **If unsuccessful**: Document learnings about chosen tech stack/design system; re-evaluate foundational choices.
