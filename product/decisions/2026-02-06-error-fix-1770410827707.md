## Overview

This decision outlines the foundational build for our product's initial user interface, focusing on implementing a modern design system, user login, and a basic dashboard. This work aims to establish a consistent and intuitive user experience from the outset, enabling future validation of core product beliefs.

## Hypothesis

As a **new user to the product**
I believe **implementing a modern design system (shadcn) with a clear Google login and a basic, functional dashboard**
Will result in **a perceived intuitive and professional initial user experience**
Because **a well-designed and consistent UI is crucial for early adoption and aligns with our belief that the product should feel obvious without documentation.**

## Context

-   **Affected Belief**: "The product must feel obvious without documentation." This foundational work directly supports our ability to test this belief later by providing a clean canvas.
-   **Current Workflow**: There is no existing workflow for new users, as the product UI does not yet exist.
-   **Pain Point**: Lack of a functional and visually consistent initial product shell prevents user testing and validation of core ideas.
-   **Success Metric**: Deployment of a functional React application with Google login and a basic dashboard, where all visible UI components consistently adhere to the shadcn design system.
-   **Reversibility**: While the core decision to build a UI is not reversible, specific design choices and dashboard features can be iterated upon. The initial implementation will focus on minimal viable components.

## Experiment Scope

-   **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
-   **Component**: `frontend`
-   **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

-   **Metric**: Functional deployment of the React application with Google login and a basic dashboard. Visual consistency of UI components with shadcn.
-   **Target**: 100% functionality for login and dashboard display, with all implemented UI elements strictly following shadcn guidelines.
-   **Measured via**: Manual QA and visual inspection upon deployment.
-   **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days from the start of development.
-   **If successful**: The foundational UI is established, allowing subsequent experiments to test user interaction and specific features.
-   **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate chosen design system, implementation approach, or scope. Document learnings in product/beliefs/history.md.
