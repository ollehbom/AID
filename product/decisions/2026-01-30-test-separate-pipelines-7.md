## Overview

This experiment aims to validate the initial user experience by building a React application with a login screen (Google OAuth) and a basic dashboard, styled with Shadcn UI, as a foundation for the product.

## Hypothesis

As a technical founder, I believe that a well-designed, functional React application with a Google login and a basic dashboard, built using Shadcn UI, will allow us to rapidly iterate on the user interface and core features. This will provide a solid foundation for future development, allowing us to quickly test and validate core product concepts, increasing the speed of learning and development.

## Context

-   **Affected Belief**: Users value speed over configurability, The primary user is technically competent, The product must feel obvious without documentation
-   **Current Workflow**: No existing application.
-   **Pain Point**: Lack of a functional product to demonstrate value and gather user feedback. Slow development of UI components.
-   **Success Metric**: Successful Google login, functional dashboard, and initial UI/UX testing by the technical founder within one week.
-   **Reversibility**: Use feature flags to roll out components and UI changes gradually, and revert to previous versions if needed. All UI components should be designed to be easily swapped.

## Experiment Scope

-   **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
-   **Component**: `frontend`
-   **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

-   **Metric**: Successful Google login, basic dashboard functionality, and UI/UX testing.
-   **Target**: Successful login and basic dashboard functionality within one week. Positive feedback from the founder on the initial UI/UX.
-   **Measured via**: Founder's feedback and internal testing.
-   **Timeline**: Evaluate after one week.
-   **If successful**: The product will have a functional, basic UI allowing us to test and validate core product concepts.
-   **If unsuccessful**: Iterate on the design or framework and gather feedback to understand the points of friction.
