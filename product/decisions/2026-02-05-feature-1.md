## Overview

Experiment to establish a modern React application foundation, including a login screen, a basic dashboard, and an initial design system using shadcn/ui.

## Hypothesis

As a development team
I believe establishing a modern React application foundation with shadcn/ui and an initial design system
Will result in accelerated feature development and a consistent, positive initial user experience
Because it provides reusable components and a clear aesthetic direction, enabling faster iteration and better user perception of quality.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This foundational work enables validation of "Users value speed over configurability" and "The product must feel obvious without documentation". New belief: "A robust design system accelerates development and enhances initial user impression."
- **Current Workflow**: No existing application foundation or standardized UI components.
- **Pain Point**: Inability to quickly prototype and test user-facing features due to lack of a basic UI/UX framework and inconsistent design.
- **Success Metric**: Completion of core foundational components (React app, Google login, basic dashboard, initial design system setup). Positive qualitative developer feedback on the utility of the design system for rapid prototyping. Positive qualitative internal stakeholder feedback on the app's initial look and feel.
- **Reversibility**: Core application structure is not easily reversible; focus on rapid initial build. Iteration on individual design system components is expected.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and running.
- [ ] shadcn/ui integrated and basic components demonstrated.
- [ ] Login screen with Google authentication implemented.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page with mock content created.
- [ ] Initial design system (e.g., color palette, typography, spacing tokens, basic component library) defined and implemented.
- [ ] Success metrics tracked (qualitative developer feedback, internal stakeholder review).
- [ ] Results evaluated after 7 days of development.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (N/A for core foundation, but components within can be flagged)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (once Design Agent provides)
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage for core components)
- [ ] Documentation updated (for design system usage)
- [ ] QA validation passed (for core features)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for initial internal build)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A for qualitative initial feedback, but subsequent metrics will have baselines)

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Completion of specified foundational features; qualitative feedback on design system utility and initial app aesthetics.
- **Target**: 100% completion of listed features within 7 working days. Positive feedback from developers and internal stakeholders.
- **Measured via**: Internal demo, code review, qualitative interviews/surveys with developers, stakeholder review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days of development.
- **If successful**: Update belief "A robust design system accelerates development and enhances initial user impression" to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md.
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in product/beliefs/history.md and document learnings, re-evaluate tech stack/scope.

## Dependencies
