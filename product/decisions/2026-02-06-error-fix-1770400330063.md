## Overview
Establish the foundational React frontend, integrating shadcn/ui for a modern design system, including a Google login screen and a basic dashboard with mock content.

## Hypothesis
As a frontend developer, I believe implementing a React application using shadcn/ui as the design system backbone, including a Google login and a basic dashboard, will result in a significant reduction in time-to-market for new UI features and improved visual consistency, because it provides a well-documented, component-based, and modern UI framework that is easy to extend and maintain.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: This decision supports our core beliefs: "Users value speed over configurability" (by enabling faster dev) and "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (by promoting consistent UI). It also introduces a new belief: "A modern, well-implemented design system (like shadcn/ui) accelerates feature development and ensures a consistent, intuitive user experience" (initially Open / Unproven).
- **Current Workflow**: Currently, there is no established frontend application or design system base.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a consistent, modern UI foundation for the product, which would lead to fragmented user experience and slower development cycles for new features.
- **Success Metric**: Qualitative feedback from the development team on ease of use and consistency; observed acceleration in building subsequent UI features.
- **Reversibility**: While the core framework choice is foundational, individual components and design decisions within the system can be iterated upon or replaced with minimal impact. The overall architectural choice is less reversible than a feature flag.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React application initialized with shadcn/ui configured.
- [ ] Functional Google login screen implemented.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page with mock content displayed after login.
- [ ] Core design system components (e.g., Button, Input, Card) are usable and styled consistently.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable for specific components/flows within the system).
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (once provided by Design Agent).
- [ ] Basic tests written for core components and login flow.
- [ ] Initial documentation for design system usage created.
- [ ] QA validation passed for login and dashboard display.
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (not applicable for initial foundational setup).
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (qualitative dev feedback).

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Developer velocity and qualitative feedback on design system usability and consistency.
- **Target**: Positive developer feedback on ease of use; observed acceleration in building the next 2-3 UI features compared to a non-existent design system scenario.
- **Measured via**: Bi-weekly syncs with the development team, observation of pull request complexity for UI changes.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 2 weeks of active development using the new system, or after 3 subsequent UI features are built.
- **If successful**: Update belief "A modern, well-implemented design system (like shadcn/ui) accelerates feature development and ensures a consistent, intuitive user experience" to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the choice of UI framework or implementation strategy, archive learnings in product/beliefs/history.md, and document reasons for failure.
