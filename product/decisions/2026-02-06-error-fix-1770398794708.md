# Decision Record: error-fix-1770398794708 - Initial UI/UX and Authentication Setup

## Overview

This decision addresses the founder's directive to establish the core UI/UX framework, including a React application with shadcn styling, Google login, a basic dashboard, and an underlying design system. This foundational work is critical for enabling future feature development and user interaction.

## Hypothesis

As a new user, I believe a modern, consistent UI/UX with basic Google login and a functional dashboard will result in successful initial product engagement and a strong foundation for future feature development because users value a polished, intuitive experience and seamless access.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This work supports the core belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by establishing a consistent and intuitive visual language. It also sets the stage for validating "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance."
- **Current Workflow**: There is no current application or workflow to interact with. This is the initial setup.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a functional user interface and authentication system prevents any user interaction and feature development.
- **Success Metric**: Completion of core UI framework, functional Google login, and a basic dashboard with mock content, validated by internal stakeholders successfully logging in and navigating.
- **Reversibility**: While the core framework (React, shadcn) is a foundational choice, individual components and design system elements can be iterated upon or redesigned. The feature flag concept is less applicable to the initial framework setup itself, but will be crucial for features built on top.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**:
    - React application successfully deployed and accessible.
    - Google login integration allows users to authenticate.
    - Basic dashboard renders mock content without errors.
    - Design system components (e.g., buttons, inputs, typography) are consistently applied.
- **Target**: 100% functionality of the above points with no critical bugs identified in internal QA.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, internal QA, code review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon initial deployment (within 1-2 weeks of development start).
- **If successful**: The established UI/UX and auth system will serve as the base for all subsequent feature development, reinforcing the belief in the importance of a polished user experience.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate framework choices, design system approach, or authentication method based on identified issues and user feedback.
