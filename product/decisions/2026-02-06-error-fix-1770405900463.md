## Overview

This decision record outlines the creation of a foundational React application, integrating a modern design system (shadcn/ui), a Google login screen, and a basic dashboard to establish a user-facing interface for future product development and experimentation.

## Hypothesis

As an early adopter/founder,
I believe that establishing a basic React app with a shadcn-based design system, a functional Google login, and a mock dashboard
Will result in a necessary foundation to conduct user-facing experiments and enable early user interaction with the product
Because a consistent and functional UI is a prerequisite for testing any user-facing feature or core product belief.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This effort is foundational and directly supports testing of "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and "Users value speed over configurability" by providing the canvas upon which these will be assessed. It's an enabling step rather than a direct test of a specific user problem.
- **Current Workflow**: Currently, there is no user-facing graphical interface for the product, limiting interaction to backend or CLI tools.
- **Pain Point**: Without a foundational UI, it's impossible to gather user feedback on interaction flows, visual intuitiveness, or feature usability, hindering the ability to validate core product beliefs effectively.
- **Success Metric**: The ability for a user to successfully log in via Google and navigate to a basic, placeholder dashboard within the React application.
- **Reversibility**: While the design system and core application setup are foundational and not easily "reversed" in the traditional sense, individual features built upon this foundation will be implemented behind feature flags, ensuring reversibility at that level. This initial setup is considered infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and configured with `shadcn/ui`.
- [ ] Google OAuth login functionality implemented and tested.
- [ ] A basic dashboard page (with mock content) accessible post-login.
- [ ] The core design system principles are established and applied consistently across the login and dashboard screens.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] React app with shadcn/ui configured.
- [ ] Google login integrated and functional.
- [ ] Basic dashboard with mock content implemented.
- [ ] Initial design system components are used.
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged to main.
- [ ] Tests written (minimal for core setup, focus on integration for login).
- [ ] Documentation updated (basic setup guide).
- [ ] QA validation passed (manual founder review).

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Successful user login and display of mock dashboard.
- **Target**: 100% functionality of login and dashboard display for internal users.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing and founder review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of initial deployment (approx. 1 week).
- **If successful**: This foundational work unblocks subsequent user-facing experiments and feature development.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate implementation and design choices, documenting learnings.

## Dependencies

- Blocks: All future user-facing experiments and UI features.
