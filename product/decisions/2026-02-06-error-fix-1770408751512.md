## Overview

This decision approves the foundational build-out of a React application. This includes integrating Shadcn UI for a modern aesthetic, implementing Google login for user authentication, creating a basic dashboard as the initial user interface, and establishing the core components of a design system.

## Hypothesis

As a founder, I believe having a modern React app with Google login and a basic dashboard, built on a robust design system, will enable faster iteration and validation of future user-facing features.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: A new implicit belief, now formalized as "A modern, well-structured frontend foundation (React, Shadcn, design system, login, dashboard) is critical for accelerating future product development and validation." This belief underpins the strategic direction provided by the founder.
- **Current State**: The product currently lacks a modern, integrated frontend application, which impedes the ability to prototype, test, and deploy new user-facing features efficiently.
- **Problem Addressed**: This foundational work addresses the critical need for a stable, scalable, and aesthetically consistent platform upon which all future user-facing features can be built. Without it, development speed and consistency would be severely hampered.
- **Success Criteria (Decision Level)**: The successful establishment and deployment of the core React application components (login, dashboard, and initial design system elements) ready for further development.
- **Reversibility**: While the overall architectural choice of a React app with a design system is a foundational commitment and not easily reversible, individual components or features built on this foundation will be designed for reversibility where appropriate.

## Experiment Scope (Decision)

- **Nature**: Foundational Build, prerequisite for subsequent experiments.
- **Expected Effort**: Medium (estimated 4-7 days for initial implementation).
- **Core Components**: Frontend application, authentication (Google), core UI (dashboard), design system setup.

## Success Evaluation (Decision)

- **Key Indicator**: The presence of a functional, deployable React application that includes the specified login, dashboard, and design system components.
- **Target**: Full functionality of the foundational elements as outlined in the requirements.
- **Measurement**: Verification through deployment and initial functional testing.
- **Timeline**: Evaluation upon the completion of the initial implementation phase.
- **Outcome**: Successful completion will validate the strategic choice for the frontend foundation and enable progression to user-facing feature experiments. Unsuccessful outcome would require re-evaluation of the foundational technology or approach.
