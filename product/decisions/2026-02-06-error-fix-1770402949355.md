## Overview\nEstablish the foundational React application with shadcn/ui, Google login, and a basic dashboard to accelerate product development.\n\n## Hypothesis\nAs a Founder (and ultimately primary user)\nI believe that creating a React app with shadcn/ui, Google login, and a basic dashboard, following modern design standards,\nWill result in a robust, intuitive, and rapidly iteratable product foundation\nBecause it aligns with the core belief that the product must feel obvious and enables quick testing of future user needs.\n\n## Context\n- **Affected Belief**: Foundational: A modern, consistent UI framework (shadcn/ui) will facilitate rapid and intuitive product development, aligning with the 'product must feel obvious' core belief.\n- **Current Workflow**: No existing application framework.\n- **Pain Point**: Inability to build and test user-facing features without a core application shell.\n- **Success Metric**: Functional React application with specified components and integrated design system.\n- **Reversibility**: While switching UI frameworks later is costly, individual components (login provider, dashboard content) are reversible. The commitment is to the React + shadcn/ui stack.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Experiment implemented behind feature flag (N/A for foundational framework)\n- [ ] Success metric tracked: Functional React app with integrated shadcn/ui, Google login, and basic dashboard.\n- [ ] Rollback plan tested (N/A, foundational commitment)\n- [ ] Results evaluated upon completion of initial setup.\n\n## Experiment Scope\n- **Size**: `epic`\n- **Component**: `frontend`\n- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`\n\n## Definition of Done\n- [ ] Feature flag configured (N/A)\n- [ ] Code implemented per design spec\n- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage)\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n- [ ] QA validation passed\n- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A, core app)\n- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A, foundational)\n\n## Success Evaluation\n- **Metric**: Completion and functional verification of the React app, login, dashboard, and design system.\n- **Target**: Fully functional and integrated initial application.\n- **Measured via**: Developer verification, basic QA.\n- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of the initial implementation.\n- **If successful**: The foundation is established for future feature development and belief testing.\n- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate UI framework or foundational approach.\n\n## Dependencies\n- Blocked by: None\n- Blocks: All future UI/UX driven features\n- Related belief: Foundational: A modern, consistent UI framework (shadcn/ui) will facilitate rapid and intuitive product development.\n\n## Related Documentation\n- Experiment tracking: `experiments/active.md`\n- Design intent: `design/intents/error-fix-1770402949355.md` (created by Design Agent)
