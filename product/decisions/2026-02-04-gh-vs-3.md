## Overview

Establish the foundational frontend for the product, including a React app, modern design system, user authentication, and a basic dashboard.

## Hypothesis

As a new user/developer
I believe having a polished, modern React application with integrated design system, Google login, and a basic dashboard
Will result in a stable and intuitive platform for immediate interaction and future feature development
Because it addresses the fundamental need for a user interface to engage with the product and validate core beliefs.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: Enables future belief testing, aligns with "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by establishing a strong design foundation.
- **Current Workflow**: No existing frontend application or design system.
- **Pain Point**: Inability to onboard users or demonstrate product functionality without a user interface. Lack of a consistent UI framework.
- **Success Metric**: Successful deployment of the React app, functional Google login, basic dashboard rendering, and successful integration of shadcn/ui components.
- **Reversibility**: The choice of React and shadcn/ui is a foundational commitment. Individual components or styling can be changed, but the core framework would be a major refactor to reverse.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and runnable.
- [ ] shadcn/ui components successfully integrated and styled.
- [ ] Google login implemented and functional.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page rendering with mock content.
- [ ] Initial design system components established.
- [ ] Success metric (functional app, login, dashboard, shadcn/ui) confirmed via manual testing.
- [ ] Rollback strategy documented (revert initial commits).
- [ ] Results evaluated after 1 week.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented per initial setup spec.
- [ ] Basic tests written for components and login flow.
- [ ] Documentation updated for running the app and its structure.
- [ ] Manual QA validation passed for core functionality.
- [ ] Success metric (functional app, login, dashboard, shadcn/ui) confirmed.

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Functional React app, successful Google login, basic dashboard rendering, shadcn/ui integrated.
- **Target**: 100% functionality and visual consistency for the implemented components.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing and code review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 1 week of implementation.
- **If successful**: This establishes the platform for future experiments. No direct belief update, but enables future belief validation.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate design system choice or implementation approach.
