## Overview\n\nImplement the foundational React application, including a login screen, dashboard, and a modern design system based on shadcn/ui.\n\n## Hypothesis\n\nAs a new user/founder\nI believe that having a basic React app with a login, dashboard, and a modern design system\nWill enable us to rapidly prototype and test future user-centric features\nBecause it establishes a consistent and extensible UI foundation.\n\n## Context\n\n- **Affected Belief**: Foundational Belief: Establishing a modern, extensible UI platform is critical for rapid prototyping and validating future user-centric beliefs.\n- **Current Workflow**: No existing UI application or design system.\n- **Pain Point**: Inability to rapidly prototype and test user-centric features due to lack of a foundational UI and consistent design language.\n- **Success Metric**: Completion of requested components (login, dashboard, design system), consistent application of the design system, and readiness for subsequent feature development.\n- **Reversibility**: While the core architecture is foundational, individual components within the design system and dashboard content can be iterated upon or replaced with minimal disruption.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] React application initialized with a robust structure.\n- [ ] shadcn/ui integrated as the styling framework.\n- [ ] Google OAuth login implemented and functional.\n- [ ] Basic dashboard page created with mock content.\n- [ ] A foundational design system established and documented (e.g., colors, typography, spacing, core components).\n\n## Experiment Scope\n\n- **Size**: `epic`\n- **Component**: `frontend`\n- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] Feature flag configured (N/A for foundational build)\n- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (Design Agent will provide spec)\n- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage)\n- [ ] Documentation updated (e.g., README, design system guidelines)\n- [ ] QA validation passed\n- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for initial internal build)\n- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A for foundational build)\n\n## Success Evaluation\n\n- **Metric**: Qualitative assessment of completeness, consistency, and readiness.\n- **Target**: Founder satisfaction with the initial look and feel and the platform's readiness to support rapid feature development.\n- **Measured via**: Founder review and internal team assessment.\n- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of this epic (estimated 2-4 weeks).\n- **If successful**: The platform is ready for user-centric belief testing; this foundational belief is validated.\n- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate foundational technology choices or design system approach.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Blocked by: None\n- Blocks: All subsequent user-centric feature development.\n- Related belief: Foundational Belief (as above)\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- Decision record: `product/decisions/error-fix-1770403454310.md` (this document)\n- Experiment tracking: `experiments/active.md`\n- Design intent: `design/intents/error-fix-1770403454310.md` (created by Design Agent)
