# Product Decision: Establish Core UI Foundation (error-fix-1770407328968)

## Overview

This decision outlines the establishment of the foundational user interface for the product, including a React application styled with Shadcn UI, a Google login mechanism, and a basic dashboard as the initial user landing page. This foundational work is critical to enable subsequent user-facing experiments and validate core product beliefs.

## Hypothesis

As an early product user, I believe that a modern, intuitive React UI foundation built with Shadcn components, featuring integrated Google login and a basic dashboard, will provide an an "obvious" product experience and an intuitive onboarding flow, thereby accelerating the validation of our core product value and user engagement in future feature testing.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: 
    - `product/beliefs/current.md` - "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (Core)
    - `product/beliefs/current.md` - "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" (Open / Unproven)
- **Current Workflow**: There is currently no user-facing UI, preventing direct user interaction and testing of product concepts.
- **Pain Point**: The absence of a foundational UI prevents the product team from conducting user-facing experiments and gathering feedback on core user experiences like onboarding and initial interaction.
- **Success Metric**: Successful deployment of a functional React application incorporating the specified UI framework, login, and dashboard components, validated by internal stakeholders (founder).
- **Reversibility**: While the core UI foundation itself is not easily reversible due to its foundational nature, future features built upon this base will be designed with reversibility in mind (e.g., feature flags).

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: medium
- **Component**: frontend
- **Phase**: phase-1-mvp

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Functional implementation of the UI foundation and positive qualitative feedback from the founder regarding intuitiveness and modern feel.
- **Target**: A fully operational React application with Shadcn styling, a working Google login, and a basic dashboard page rendering mock content. The foundational design system components should be ready for use by designers and developers.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing and founder review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate functionality and founder satisfaction within 7 days of completion.
- **If successful**: The established UI foundation will serve as the base for all subsequent user-facing experiments. The belief "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" will move closer to validation, and "The product must feel obvious without documentation" will be reinforced.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen UI framework (Shadcn UI) and the overall approach to establishing the product's visual and interactive foundation. Document learnings in `product/beliefs/history.md`.
