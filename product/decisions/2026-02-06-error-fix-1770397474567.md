## Overview
This decision outlines the foundational work to establish a modern React frontend application, integrating `shadcn/ui` for styling, implementing Google login, and creating a basic dashboard as the starting page.

## Hypothesis
As a **founder**, I believe **building a React app with a `shadcn/ui` design system, Google login, and a basic dashboard** will result in **a robust and intuitive frontend foundation for future product iterations** because **it aligns with our belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and enables rapid future development and belief testing.**

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: This work implicitly supports "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by establishing a consistent and modern UI/UX foundation. It also enables future testing of "Users value speed over configurability" and "The primary user is technically competent" by providing a platform for features.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing frontend application or established design system.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a coherent, modern frontend foundation prevents further product development and testing of user-facing beliefs.
- **Success Metric**: Functional application, working Google login, accessible dashboard, and visible integration of `shadcn/ui` components.
- **Reversibility**: Low. This is a foundational architectural decision. Major issues would require significant refactoring or a re-evaluation of the chosen tech stack, rather than a simple rollback via a feature flag. The chosen technologies (React, Shadcn) are widely supported, mitigating risk.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] React application successfully initialized and running.
- [x] Google login functionality implemented and tested.
- [x] Basic dashboard page accessible after successful login.
- [x] `shadcn/ui` integrated and used for styling on login and dashboard pages (at least 3 distinct components used).
- [x] Initial design system principles (e.g., consistent typography, color palette, spacing) applied across implemented components.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done
- [x] Feature flag configured (N/A for foundational app setup, but will be used for subsequent features).
- [x] Code implemented per design spec.
- [x] Tests written (basic integration tests for login/dashboard navigation).
- [x] Documentation updated (basic setup instructions).
- [x] QA validation passed (manual validation of login/dashboard).
- [x] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A, this is a core build).
- [x] Success metric baseline captured (N/A, this is a new foundation).

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Functionality of core components (app load, login, dashboard access, UI consistency).
- **Target**: 100% functional, visually consistent with `shadcn/ui` styling.
- **Measured via**: Internal testing and founder review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of this initial build phase.
- **If successful**: This foundational work enables the next phase of feature development and belief testing. No direct belief update to
