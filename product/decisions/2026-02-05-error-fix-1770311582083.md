## Overview
This experiment aims to establish the foundational user interface of the product by building a React application styled with Shadcn UI, including a Google login screen and a basic dashboard. This will also involve setting up a foundational design system.

## Hypothesis
As a founder, I believe that implementing a modern React application with Shadcn UI, Google login, and a basic dashboard will establish a robust and extensible product foundation, leading to efficient future feature development and a positive initial user experience, because it aligns with modern design standards and provides a coherent framework.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: This is a foundational build, implicitly reinforcing "The primary user is technically competent" by providing a high-quality interface, and setting the stage for "The product must feel obvious without documentation" through a well-designed system. It establishes a new core belief about the product's technical and design foundation.
- **Current Workflow**: There is currently no functional application or user interface.
- **Pain Point**: The absence of a core application prevents any user interaction or further feature development.
- **Success Metric**: A fully functional React application with integrated Shadcn UI, a working Google login flow, and a navigable basic dashboard displaying mock content. The foundational design system should be defined and implemented.
- **Reversibility**: While the core framework setup is a significant initial investment and not easily "reversed" without rebuilding, individual UI components and design system elements can be iterated upon. The risk of the core choice (React/Shadcn) being wrong is mitigated by its industry standard adoption.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React application successfully initialized and running.
- [ ] Shadcn UI integrated and basic components (e.g., Button, Card) are usable.
- [ ] Google login functionality implemented and successfully authenticates users.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page created with mock content.
- [ ] Core design system principles and initial components defined.
- [ ] All implemented features are behind a feature flag (if applicable, though for core setup, it might be the entire app).

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable, e.g., for specific sections of the dashboard).
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (once Design Agent provides it).
- [ ] Tests written (e.g., for login flow, component rendering).
- [ ] Documentation updated (e.g., README for setup, design system guide).
- [ ] QA validation passed (functional testing of login and dashboard).
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for initial app, but for future features).
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (N/A, this is a foundational build).

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Functional React app, successful Google login, accessible dashboard, defined design system.
- **Target**: 100% functionality as described in acceptance criteria.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, code review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of this initial build phase.
- **If successful**: Update belief to "Core: A modern React application built with Shadcn UI provides a robust and extensible foundation for product development."
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in product/beliefs/history.md and document learnings (e.g., issues with Shadcn, auth complexity).
