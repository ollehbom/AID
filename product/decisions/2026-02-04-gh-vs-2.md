## Overview

Experiment to create the foundational React application with Google login and a basic dashboard, styled using shadcn/ui, to establish the base for future product development.

## Hypothesis

As a founder/developer
I believe a basic React application with Google login and a placeholder dashboard, built with a modern design system (shadcn/ui)
Will provide a sufficient foundation to begin validating core product ideas and user interactions
Because it enables rapid prototyping and ensures a consistent, modern user experience from the outset.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: The product must feel obvious without documentation; The primary user is technically competent.
- **Current Workflow**: No application foundation exists.
- **Pain Point**: Inability to start building and validating product ideas without a basic app structure.
- **Success Metric**: A deployable React application with functional Google login and a basic dashboard, consistently styled with shadcn/ui.
- **Reversibility**: Code changes are version controlled and can be reverted. This is a foundational build, so the implementation itself is reversible, though the overall strategic direction of "building an app" is not.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Experiment implemented: React app with Google login and basic dashboard created.
- [ ] Success metric tracked: App is deployed, Google login is functional, dashboard displays mock content, and shadcn/ui styling is consistently applied.
- [ ] Rollback plan tested: (N/A for initial app foundation; code versioning provides reversibility)
- [ ] Results evaluated after 7 days of development or upon initial deployment.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (N/A for this foundational build, but for future features on it)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (from Design Agent)
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage for core components)
- [ ] Documentation updated (basic setup and deployment instructions)
- [ ] QA validation passed (internal review of functionality and styling)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for initial internal deployment)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (initial functionality confirmed upon deployment)

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Functional deployment, Google login, basic dashboard visibility, consistent shadcn/ui styling.
- **Target**: 100% functionality and visual consistency.
- **Measured via**: Manual verification, internal stakeholder review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days (or completion of "medium" task).
- **If successful**: Foundation established, proceed to next experiments.
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in product/beliefs/history.md and document learnings, re-evaluate foundational technology or approach.

## Dependencies

- Blocked by: None
- Blocks: Future feature development
- Related belief: The product must feel obvious without documentation (a modern UI supports this).
