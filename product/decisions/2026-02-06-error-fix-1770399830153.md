## Overview

Decision to initiate the foundational build of the product's frontend application, incorporating a modern design system, user authentication, and a basic dashboard, as per founder's direction.

## Hypothesis

As a founder, I believe that building a basic React app with `shadcn/ui` for styling, Google login for authentication, and a dashboard with mock content will provide a robust, modern, and intuitive application foundation, which will allow us to rapidly test core product beliefs and user workflows.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This work implicitly supports "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by establishing a strong design system foundation. It is foundational for testing all future product beliefs.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no current application workflow; this is the initial product build.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a functional, modern application foundation to begin iterating on user feedback and testing core beliefs.
- **Success Metric**: The application successfully loads, a user can log in via Google, the dashboard displays mock content, and the design system components are consistently applied.
- **Reversibility**: While the core architectural decisions (React, `shadcn/ui`) are hard to reverse, individual components and design system choices can be iterated upon. The initial scope is minimal to reduce commitment.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Functional React application, successful Google login, dashboard rendering mock content, `shadcn/ui` components integrated.
- **Target**: 100% functionality for specified features.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing and developer verification.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon initial implementation.
- **If successful**: The application foundation is established, allowing for subsequent feature development and belief testing. This validates the chosen tech stack for rapid UI development.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen technologies (React, `shadcn/ui`, Google Auth integration difficulty) or scope.
