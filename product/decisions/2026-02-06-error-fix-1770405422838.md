## Overview

Establish the foundational React frontend application with a modern design system using shadcn, including a login screen with Google authentication and a basic dashboard. This initiative aims to create a robust and consistent UI foundation for all future product development.

## Hypothesis

As a `developer building new features`
I believe `implementing a React app with a shadcn-based design system and core authentication/dashboard components`
Will result in `accelerated feature development and a consistent, modern user experience`
Because `it provides a robust and standardized UI foundation`.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This effort reinforces the "Users value speed over configurability" (by enabling faster developer iteration) and "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (by establishing consistent UI patterns). It also establishes a new foundational belief regarding the importance of a modern design system for development velocity and user experience.
- **Current Workflow**: Currently, there is no established frontend application or standardized design system, leading to ad-hoc UI development and potential inconsistencies.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a consistent, scalable, and modern UI foundation slows down development, increases technical debt, and risks an inconsistent user experience across the application.
- **Success Metric**: Developer velocity for subsequent UI tasks, adherence to design system principles in new components, and positive feedback from future users regarding app consistency and intuitiveness.
- **Reversibility**: The core framework choice (React, shadcn) is a foundational decision with significant implications, making it not easily reversible. However, specific component implementations and design decisions within the system are iterative and can be refined. This is a strategic foundation, rather than a small, isolated feature.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized with modern tooling.
- [ ] `shadcn/ui` integrated and configured according to best practices.
- [ ] Login screen implemented with Google OAuth authentication.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page created with mock content as the starting view post-login.
- [ ] Core design system principles (e.g., color palette, typography, spacing, component variants) established in the codebase.
- [ ] Application is accessible and functional via a local development server.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable for gradual rollout of components, though this is foundational).
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (to be provided by Design Agent).
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage for core components).
- [ ] Basic documentation for design system usage updated.
- [ ] QA validation passed for core flows (login, dashboard display).
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (for future features built on this foundation).
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (initial developer velocity, consistency checks).

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Developer velocity for building new UI features; consistency of user interface across the app; qualitative feedback on intuitiveness.
- **Target**: Initial setup complete within one sprint. Future UI component implementation time reduced by 20% compared to ad-hoc development. High adherence to design system standards.
- **Measured via**: Internal team feedback, code review assessments, future user studies/feedback.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate initial setup upon completion (approx. 1 week). Ongoing evaluation for developer velocity and UI consistency over subsequent sprints.
- **If successful**: Update belief to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md regarding the efficacy of a modern design system for product development.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen design system, implementation strategy, or developer tooling.
