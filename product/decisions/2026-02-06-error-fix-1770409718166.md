## Overview

Establish the foundational user interface for the React application using `shadcn/ui`, including a login screen with Google authentication and a basic dashboard with mock content. This is an initial experiment to set up the core UI framework and validate its effectiveness.

## Hypothesis

As a `developer and future user`,
I believe `implementing a React app with shadcn/ui for foundational elements (login, dashboard, design system)`
Will result in `faster development of future features and a modern, intuitive user experience`
Because `a consistent, modern design system is crucial for rapid iteration and positive user perception, aligning with the core belief that the product must feel obvious without documentation`.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This experiment implicitly supports the core belief "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by aiming for an intuitive UI. It also introduces a new hypothesis: "Implementing a modern design system (e.g., `shadcn/ui`) significantly accelerates frontend development and ensures a consistent, intuitive user experience."
- **Current Workflow**: Currently, there is no established user interface or design system for the application.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a visual interface prevents demonstrating product capabilities, gathering user interaction feedback, and standardizing frontend development.
- **Success Metric**: Successful user login and navigation to the dashboard; positive qualitative feedback on UI aesthetics and ease of use; developer velocity for subsequent UI tasks using `shadcn/ui` components.
- **Reversibility**: While the initial choice of `shadcn/ui` is foundational, individual components can be refactored. The overall design system can be evolved or, in an extreme case, replaced, but this is a significant upfront decision for a new application.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**:
    - Functional: 100% successful login via Google and access to the basic dashboard.
    - Qualitative: Positive feedback from internal users/founders on the initial look, feel, and intuitiveness of the UI.
    - Developer Experience: Developers report ease of use and efficiency gains when building with `shadcn/ui`.
- **Target**: Achieve functional login and dashboard, receive generally positive qualitative feedback, and confirm developer satisfaction with the design system.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, founder/internal user feedback sessions, informal developer surveys.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate initial implementation after 2 weeks of internal use and feature development.
- **If successful**: The belief "Implementing a modern design system (e.g., `shadcn/ui`) significantly accelerates frontend development and ensures a consistent, intuitive user experience" will be moved from `Open / Unproven` to `Core`.
- **If unsuccessful**: Document learnings in `product/beliefs/history.md`, re-evaluate the chosen UI framework or implementation strategy, and consider alternative approaches to establishing the frontend foundation.
