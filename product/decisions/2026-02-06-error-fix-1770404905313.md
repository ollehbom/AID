## Overview
Establish core React frontend with `shadcn/ui` design system, Google login, and a basic dashboard to accelerate future feature development and ensure consistent user experience.

## Hypothesis
As a founder,
I believe establishing a modern React application foundation using `shadcn/ui` for the design system, complete with Google login and a basic dashboard,
Will enable faster iteration on user-facing features and ensure a cohesive user experience from the outset,
Because it provides standardized components and a clear visual language.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: "The product must feel obvious without documentation", "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance"
- **Current Workflow**: No existing UI frontend.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a foundational UI to build and test user-facing features quickly and consistently.
- **Success Metric**: A deployed React application accessible via URL, showing `shadcn/ui` components, functional Google login, and a basic dashboard view post-authentication.
- **Reversibility**: Code rollback to previous state.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Existence and functionality of the core UI components and flows.
- **Target**: 100% functional (app runs, login works, dashboard appears).
- **Measured via**: Manual verification by product/engineering team.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days of development and initial setup.
- **If successful**: This foundation enables faster iteration and testing of user-facing features. Beliefs about "obviousness" and "intuitive onboarding" can then be tested.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate choice of `shadcn/ui` or implementation strategy.
