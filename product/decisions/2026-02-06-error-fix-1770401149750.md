# Product Decision Record: error-fix-1770401149750

## Overview

Decision to initiate the development of the core application UI, including a modern design system, Google login, and a basic dashboard, to establish the foundational user experience.

## Hypothesis

As a new user,
I believe that a React application styled with Shadcn UI, featuring Google login and a basic dashboard,
Will result in an intuitive and obvious initial experience, allowing successful login and access to core application views without confusion,
Because this validates our belief that "the product must feel obvious without documentation" from the very first interaction.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (Core), "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" (Open / Unproven)
- **Current Workflow**: No existing application UI. Users currently have no way to interact with the product visually.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a foundational user interface prevents any user interaction or validation of core product beliefs.
- **Success Metric**: High successful Google login rate and positive founder feedback on initial intuitiveness.
- **Reversibility**: The core application setup can be iterated upon or re-developed, but this is a foundational step, making "reversibility" more about flexibility to pivot rather than a feature flag. The chosen technologies (React, Shadcn) are standard and flexible.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**:
    1.  Percentage of users successfully completing Google login.
    2.  Qualitative feedback from founder/internal team on the intuitiveness and clarity of the login and dashboard experience.
- **Target**:
    1.  95% successful Google login completion.
    2.  Founder confirms the initial experience is "obvious without documentation."
- **Measured via**: Internal testing, direct feedback.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days of internal dogfooding post-deployment.
- **If successful**: Strengthen the belief that a modern, simple UI leads to an obvious user experience. Proceed with further design and development of core features.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the login flow, UI design, or initial dashboard content, and potentially the core beliefs regarding user intuition.
