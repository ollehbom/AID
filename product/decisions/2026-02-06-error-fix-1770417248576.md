## Overview

This decision initiates the development of a foundational React application, incorporating a modern design system (shadcn/ui), Google login, and a basic dashboard to establish the core user interface for the product.

## Hypothesis

As a new user,
I believe that a standard React application with a consistent design system (shadcn/ui) and Google login will allow me to successfully access a basic dashboard,
Will result in providing the foundational interface necessary to validate core product beliefs and enable future experiments,
Because the product currently lacks a user-facing application to interact with.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This experiment supports the core beliefs: "Users value speed over configurability", "The primary user is technically competent", and "The product must feel obvious without documentation". It provides the necessary interface to test these beliefs in practice.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no current user-facing application for users to log in or interact with product features.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a basic, usable application interface prevents any user interaction and validation of product value.
- **Success Metric**: User successfully logs in via Google and reaches the basic dashboard. The application consistently applies the shadcn/ui design system.
- **Reversibility**: Frontend framework and design system choices are significant, but individual components can be swapped or the UI can be refactored if needed. The core application can be rolled back to a previous state.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and running.
- [ ] Shadcn/ui integrated and used for basic components.
- [ ] Google login implemented and functional.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page accessible after login with mock content.
- [ ] Initial design system setup documented for developer use.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] React app scaffolding complete.
- [ ] Shadcn/ui dependency added and configured.
- [ ] Google OAuth integration for login.
- [ ] Login screen and basic dashboard components implemented.
- [ ] Initial component library (from shadcn/ui) available.
- [ ] Basic routing implemented.
- [ ] Tests written for core login flow.
- [ ] Documentation updated for frontend setup.
- [ ] QA validation passed for login and dashboard access.

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Percentage of test users (or internal users) successfully logging in via Google and reaching the dashboard. Developer adoption/satisfaction with the design system.
- **Target**: 100% of test users successfully complete login and dashboard access. Positive feedback from developers on design system utility.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, analytics for login events, developer surveys/interviews.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days of initial deployment.
- **If successful**: Update belief to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md (implicitly confirming the need for a foundational UI to test other beliefs).
- **If unsuccessful**: Document learnings in product/beliefs/history.md, troubleshoot login/UI issues, re-evaluate design system choice.
