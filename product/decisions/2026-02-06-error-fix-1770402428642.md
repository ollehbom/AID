## Overview

Establish the foundational frontend architecture for the product, including a React application, integration with `shadcn/ui` for modern styling, a Google login screen, and a basic dashboard. This will serve as the canvas for future feature development and user experience testing.

## Hypothesis

As a **product team**
I believe **implementing a React app with `shadcn/ui`, Google login, and a basic dashboard, guided by a modern design system,**
Will result in **a robust and intuitive frontend foundation that aligns with our belief of an obvious product experience and enables rapid iteration,**
Because **a consistent and modern UI framework is essential for user adoption and efficient development.**

## Context

- **Affected Belief**:
    - "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (The design system will contribute to this.)
    - "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" (The Google login will be an initial test of this.)
- **Current Workflow**: No existing frontend application.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a modern, consistent, and functional frontend foundation to build upon.
- **Success Metric**:
    - Functional React application with `shadcn/ui` integrated.
    - Working Google login flow.
    - Basic dashboard page with mock content.
    - Initial design system principles documented and applied.
    - Founder validation of the initial user experience.
- **Reversibility**: While the core framework choice is significant, individual components and design choices can be iterated upon. The `shadcn/ui` components are modular.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and running.
- [ ] `shadcn/ui` integrated and basic components (e.g., Button, Input) are usable.
- [ ] Google login component implemented and functional, allowing user authentication.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page created with placeholder content, accessible after login.
- [ ] Initial design system principles (e.g., typography, color palette, spacing) are defined and implemented using `shadcn/ui` theming.
- [ ] Founder review and approval of the initial setup and design direction.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `epic`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] React app scaffolding complete.
- [ ] `shadcn/ui` setup and configuration verified.
- [ ] Google OAuth integration implemented.
- [ ] Login/Logout flow functional.
- [ ] Protected dashboard route accessible post-login.
- [ ] Basic global styling (fonts, colors, spacing) applied via `shadcn/ui` theming.
- [ ] Initial README for frontend setup and design system guidelines.
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged to `main` branch.

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Completion of specified components and founder's satisfaction with the initial user experience.
- **Target**: All acceptance criteria met and positive founder feedback.
- **Measured via**: Manual verification, founder review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 2 weeks for initial functional prototype.
- **If successful**: This foundation will enable further feature development. Update belief to "Core" on successful execution of the design system principles.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate framework choices or design system approach.
