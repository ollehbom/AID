## Overview
Establish the core React application, integrate Shadcn UI, implement Google login, and set up a basic dashboard with mock content to lay the foundation for the product's user interface and experience.

## Hypothesis
As a technically competent user,
I believe that a modern React application utilizing Shadcn UI components and a Google login
Will enable an intuitive and efficient initial user experience,
Because this aligns with modern web standards and our belief in minimal friction.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (Core), "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" (Open / Unproven)
- **Current Workflow**: N/A (establishing initial product foundation)
- **Pain Point**: N/A (proactively building the core user interface and experience)
- **Success Metric**: Successful implementation of core UI, functional Google login, dashboard loads correctly, positive founder feedback on initial intuitiveness.
- **Reversibility**: The foundational application can be refactored or rebuilt if the chosen tech stack or design direction proves unsuitable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React app initialized with Shadcn
- [ ] Google login implemented and functional
- [ ] Basic dashboard with mock content rendered
- [ ] Core design system components established

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: small`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature flag configured (N/A for foundational app, but part of general process)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] QA validation passed
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Successful Google login, dashboard rendering, founder feedback on intuitiveness.
- **Target**: 100% functional login, dashboard accessible, positive founder review.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, founder review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 5 working days post-implementation.
- **If successful**: Reinforce belief that the chosen UI/UX foundation aligns with intuitiveness and efficiency.
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in product/beliefs/history.md and document learnings, re-evaluate design system, login flow, or tech stack.
