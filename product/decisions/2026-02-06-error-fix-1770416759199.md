## Overview

This decision outlines the foundational build-out for the new React application, incorporating Shadcn UI, Google login, a basic dashboard, and an initial design system to establish a modern and intuitive user experience.

## Hypothesis

As a **future product user**
I believe **a modern React application foundation with Shadcn UI, Google login, and a consistent design system**
Will result in **a highly intuitive and visually appealing product that enables rapid feature development and user adoption**
Because **it aligns with current best practices for user experience and development efficiency, supporting the core belief that users value speed and obvious interfaces.**

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This effort reinforces the core beliefs: "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and "Users value speed over configurability." It also lays the groundwork for testing other open beliefs once a functional product exists.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no current workflow; this is the initial product foundation.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a functional application shell and consistent design language prevents further development and user testing.
- **Success Metric**: Successful deployment of the foundational app, functional Google login, consistent UI elements via the design system, and positive founder feedback on the initial look and feel.
- **Reversibility**: While the core tech stack choice is a commitment, individual design system components and dashboard layouts can be iterated upon. The implementation should allow for modular changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application successfully set up and runnable locally.
- [ ] Shadcn UI integrated and basic components (e.g., Button, Input, Card) are functional.
- [ ] Login screen implemented with functional Google authentication.
- [ ] User successfully redirected to a basic dashboard with mock content post-login.
- [ ] Initial design system principles documented and applied to core components.
- [ ] Founder reviews and approves the initial look, feel, and functionality.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Core React app setup complete.
- [ ] Shadcn UI integrated.
- [ ] Google login implemented and tested.
- [ ] Basic dashboard with mock content rendered.
- [ ] Initial design system components (Button, Input, Card) implemented and styled.
- [ ] Basic routing for login and dashboard established.
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged to main branch.
- [ ] Documentation updated (e.g., README for setup).

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Completion of acceptance criteria, positive founder review.
- **Target**: All acceptance criteria met within the estimated `medium` timeframe, and founder satisfaction with the foundational UI/UX.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, founder feedback.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days from start.
- **If successful**: Proceed with next set of features/experiments, strengthening the belief in the chosen tech stack and design approach.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate chosen tech stack, design system approach, or scope. Document learnings in product/beliefs/history.md.
