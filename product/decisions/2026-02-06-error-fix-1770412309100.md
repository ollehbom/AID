## Overview

Establish the foundational React application, integrating Shadcn UI for a modern design system, and implementing Google authentication and a basic dashboard as the initial user interface.

## Hypothesis

As an early user,
I believe a foundational React app with modern UI (Shadcn) and Google login
Will allow me to access the product's starting point,
Because we need a basic interactive surface to test any product value and gather early feedback.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This experiment establishes a foundational user interface necessary for validating future core product beliefs. It aligns with "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by building a modern, intuitive base.
- **Current Workflow**: There is currently no user-facing application or interactive workflow.
- **Pain Point**: Users cannot interact with the product; there is no user interface to test core value propositions or gather feedback on usability.
- **Success Metric**: Successful Google login, basic dashboard rendering, developers' ability to efficiently use Shadcn components for future UI.
- **Reversibility**: While replacing the entire foundational framework is a large effort, individual components and the dashboard's content can be easily modified or feature-flagged. The choice of Shadcn UI is a widely adopted, low-risk decision for modern web development.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and running.
- [ ] Shadcn UI library integrated and basic components are usable.
- [ ] Google Login implemented and users can successfully authenticate.
- [ ] A basic dashboard page is accessible post-login with mock content.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (for future dashboard content, not the app itself)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage for core components)
- [ ] Documentation updated (setup instructions, component usage)
- [ ] QA validation passed (login, basic navigation)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for foundational MVP, direct deployment)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (initial login success rate)

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Successful Google login rate; Accessibility of dashboard; Developer feedback on Shadcn usability.
- **Target**: 100% successful Google login; 100% dashboard accessibility; Positive developer feedback on Shadcn.
- **Measured via**: Automated tests, manual QA, developer surveys/interviews.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 1 week post-deployment.
- **If successful**: The foundational UI is established, enabling subsequent feature development and belief validation.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen UI framework (Shadcn) or Google login integration.
