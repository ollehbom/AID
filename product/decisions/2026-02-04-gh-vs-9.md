## Overview
This decision outlines the foundational implementation of a React application, establishing a modern design system using `shadcn/ui`, integrating Google login, and creating a basic dashboard with mock content. This is a critical first step to provide a consistent and intuitive user experience from the outset.

## Hypothesis
As a technical founder, I believe that establishing a consistent design system with `shadcn/ui` and core UI elements (login, dashboard) will enable rapid future development and provide a clean, intuitive user experience from the start, because it aligns with modern UI/UX expectations and reduces cognitive load.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: `product/beliefs/current.md#core-the-product-must-feel-obvious-without-documentation`, `product/beliefs/current.md#core-users-value-speed-over-configurability`
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application UI or established design system.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a foundational UI/UX leads to inconsistent development efforts, potential technical debt, and an undefined user experience that could hinder early adoption and understanding.
- **Success Metric**: Internal team satisfaction with the development experience using `shadcn/ui` (e.g., speed of component creation, consistency), and the perceived 'modernity' and 'intuitiveness' of the initial application from internal stakeholder review.
- **Reversibility**: The choice of a foundational UI library like `shadcn/ui` is a significant architectural decision and is not easily reversible in the short term. However, individual components and features built upon this system can be iterated or refactored. The initial setup serves as a baseline for all subsequent UI development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React application initialized and configured.
- [ ] `shadcn/ui` integrated and styled according to modern standards.
- [ ] Google Login functionality implemented and tested.
- [ ] A basic dashboard page with mock content is created and accessible post-login.
- [ ] Initial design system principles and usage guidelines are internally documented.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: small`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] React app initialized and configured.
- [ ] `shadcn/ui` integrated and styled.
- [ ] Google Login implemented.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page with mock content created.
- [ ] Initial design system documentation completed.
- [ ] Internal QA validation passed.

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Internal team feedback on development velocity and perceived intuitiveness.
- **Target**: Positive internal review from the engineering and product team; 80% consensus on the suitability of `shadcn/ui` as the foundational UI library.
- **Measured via**: Internal team feedback sessions and review of the implemented components.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days of initial implementation and internal review.
- **If successful**: The established design system and initial UI components will serve as the foundation for all future frontend development, supporting the belief that a strong design system leads to an obvious and intuitive product.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the choice of UI library or design approach, document learnings, and consider alternative foundational strategies.
