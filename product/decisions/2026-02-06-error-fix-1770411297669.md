## Overview

This decision outlines the initial setup of the core React application, including integration of a modern design system (Shadcn UI), a functional Google login screen, and a basic dashboard with mock content. This foundational work aims to establish a consistent user experience and accelerate future feature development.

## Hypothesis

As a new user, I believe a modern, intuitive UI (backed by Shadcn and a consistent design system) with basic authentication and a dashboard will provide a strong first impression, enable a clear understanding of the product's value proposition, and allow for rapid iteration on subsequent features.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This effort primarily reinforces the core belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by establishing a clear, modern, and intuitive visual language from the outset. It also supports "Users value speed over configurability" by providing a fast-to-develop and fast-to-use interface.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application or user workflow. This is the initial product build.
- **Pain Point**: The current pain point is the absence of a functional, visually coherent application, which prevents any user interaction or feature testing.
- **Success Metric**: The successful delivery of a functional React application that includes a Google login, a basic dashboard, and demonstrates a consistent design system based on Shadcn UI and modern standards.
- **Reversibility**: This is a foundational build for the application. While individual components can be refactored, the overall decision to build a React app with Shadcn and a design system is a core architectural choice and not easily reversible in the context of an "experiment." If this approach proves fundamentally flawed, it would necessitate a complete pivot.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `epic`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Completion and functional integration of the React application with all specified components (Shadcn styling, Google login, basic dashboard, design system implementation).
- **Target**: 100% of the described components are implemented and functional, presenting a cohesive and modern user interface.
- **Measured via**: Manual review and functional testing upon completion of the initial build.
- **Timeline**: Evaluation upon delivery of the initial MVP.
- **If successful**: The foundational UI is established. Belief "The product must feel obvious without documentation" is further validated by a strong initial UI. Proceed with next feature development.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen technology stack, design approach, or initial product vision. Archive learnings.
