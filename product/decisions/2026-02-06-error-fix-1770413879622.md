## Overview
This decision outlines the foundational work to establish the core UI and authentication for the new product, based on founder feedback. The goal is to create a modern, consistent application shell ready for feature development.

## Hypothesis
As a prospective user,
I believe implementing a modern React UI with Shadcn, including Google login and a basic dashboard,
Will result in a clear, intuitive first interaction with the product and a robust foundation for accelerating future feature validation,
Because a strong initial user experience reduces onboarding friction and accelerates product validation.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: Supports existing core beliefs: "The product must feel obvious without documentation", "Users value speed over configurability", and "The primary user is technically competent". This foundational work provides the platform to uphold these beliefs.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application or user workflow; this is the initial build.
- **Pain Point**: Inability to onboard users, test features, or demonstrate product value without a basic, functional, and visually consistent application shell.
- **Success Metric**: Functional Google login, accessible dashboard displaying mock content, and consistent application of Shadcn UI components.
- **Reversibility**: The codebase will be designed for modularity, allowing for future refactoring or potential framework changes without requiring a full rebuild.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Core UI components implemented
- [ ] Google login successfully authenticates users
- [ ] Basic dashboard with mock content is accessible post-login
- [ ] Shadcn UI components are consistently applied across the application

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Number of successful Google logins, dashboard accessibility, and visual consistency of UI components.
- **Target**: 100% functional Google login, dashboard, and consistent Shadcn UI implementation.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing and visual inspection upon initial deployment.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of the initial implementation and deployment.
- **If successful**: Confirms the chosen UI framework and foundational architecture are suitable, and establishes a solid base for future feature development. Update belief to "Core" (implicitly, as it supports existing core beliefs).
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen UI framework (Shadcn) or the authentication approach (Google Login) based on implementation challenges or user feedback on intuitiveness. Document learnings in product/beliefs/history.md.

## Dependencies
- Blocked by: None
- Blocks: All subsequent feature development
- Related belief: Supports core product beliefs related to user experience and technical competency.
