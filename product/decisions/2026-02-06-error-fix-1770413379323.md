## Overview

This decision outlines the foundational work to establish the product's initial user interface. It focuses on creating a basic React application with Google login, a mock dashboard, and the implementation of a modern design system using shadcn/ui. This is a critical first step to enable user interaction and subsequent feature development and belief validation.

## Hypothesis

As a first-time user, I believe that providing a basic React application with Google login, a mock dashboard, and a foundational design system will enable successful user onboarding and initial product interaction, because a functional and intuitive user interface is essential for validating core user needs and product beliefs.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This experiment supports and provides the platform for validating several core beliefs, including "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance".
- **Current Workflow**: There is currently no user-facing interface, preventing any user interaction with the product.
- **Pain Point**: Users cannot log in, access, or interact with any part of the product, making it impossible to gather feedback on user needs or test hypotheses.
- **Success Metric**: Successful Google login rate; basic dashboard loads without critical errors; initial design system components are consistently applied.
- **Reversibility**: While the choice of React and shadcn/ui is a foundational decision, individual UI components and the design system's implementation can be iterated upon and redesigned. Significant changes to the core framework would be a larger effort.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Percentage of successful Google logins; absence of critical errors on initial dashboard load.
- **Target**: >95% successful Google logins; 0 critical errors on dashboard load.
- **Measured via**: Frontend analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, custom logging) and error monitoring.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 1 week of initial deployment to ensure stability and basic functionality.
- **If successful**: The foundation for user interaction is established. We will proceed with building features on this platform, using it to validate other core beliefs.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the UI framework choice, the login process, or the design system approach if users struggle with basic interaction or encounter significant technical issues.
