## Overview

Define and build the foundational React application, including a login screen with Google authentication, a basic dashboard with mock content, and the integration of `shadcn/ui` as the core design system.

## Hypothesis

As a **new user**,
I believe a **React application with Google login and a basic dashboard, consistently styled with `shadcn/ui`**,
Will result in **a fast, obvious, and modern entry point to the product**,
Because **our core beliefs prioritize speed and intuitiveness, and a well-implemented design system supports these principles from the outset**.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: "The product must feel obvious without documentation" (Core), "Users value speed over configurability" (Core). This foundational build is a critical step in embodying these beliefs.
- **Current Workflow**: N/A (This is the initial product foundation).
- **Pain Point**: N/A (This addresses the need to establish a functional and aesthetically aligned product entry point).
- **Success Metric**: Successful Google login, basic dashboard loads without errors, consistent application of `shadcn/ui` components throughout the defined scope.
- **Reversibility**: While the choice of React and `shadcn/ui` is a significant architectural decision (high effort to reverse), the specific implementation of login and dashboard components can be easily iterated or redesigned based on feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and runnable locally.
- [ ] Login screen implemented with Google OAuth integration.
- [ ] Successful Google login redirects to the dashboard.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page displays mock content.
- [ ] All UI components within this scope (login, dashboard shell) are styled using `shadcn/ui`.
- [ ] The overall look and feel aligns with modern design standards as evaluated by the founder.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: small` (1-3 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Core React app setup complete.
- [ ] Google Auth configured and functional.
- [ ] Basic dashboard route and component created.
- [ ] `shadcn/ui` integrated and applied to components.
- [ ] Basic end-to-end login/dashboard flow tested.
- [ ] Founder review and approval of initial UI/UX alignment.

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Functional Google login, dashboard loads, consistent `shadcn/ui` application.
- **Target**: 100% functionality for the specified components and positive founder feedback on aesthetic alignment.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, founder review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of this initial build (e.g., within 3 working days).
- **If successful**: Reinforce core beliefs regarding intuitive and fast user experience through modern UI. Proceed with next foundational features.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate choice of UI framework, login strategy, or architectural approach for core frontend. Document learnings in `product/beliefs/history.md`.
