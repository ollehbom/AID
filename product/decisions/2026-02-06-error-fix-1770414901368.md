## Overview

Establish the core React application with Shadcn UI, a login screen, and a basic dashboard, alongside a foundational design system to enable rapid and consistent UI development.

## Hypothesis

As a founding team
I believe establishing a React application with Shadcn UI and a basic design system
Will result in rapid and consistent development of future user-facing features
Because it provides a modern, extensible UI foundation.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This effort supports "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and "Users value speed over configurability" by providing a consistent and efficient UI foundation.
- **Current Workflow**: No existing application. This is the initial foundational setup.
- **Pain Point**: Without a consistent UI framework and app structure, future feature development will be slow, inconsistent, and prone to technical debt.
- **Success Metric**: Initial app setup (login, dashboard) completed within 5 days. Subsequent small feature implementation time is <= 2 days using the new system.
- **Reversibility**: While foundational, specific framework choices (e.g., Shadcn) could be swapped, though with significant effort. The core React app structure is standard.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React application initialized and configured
- [ ] Shadcn UI integrated and basic components demonstrated
- [ ] Login screen implemented with Google OAuth integration
- [ ] Basic dashboard page with mock content created
- [ ] Core design tokens and system principles documented (initial draft)
- [ ] Success metrics tracked: time to complete initial setup, time for next small feature.
- [ ] Rollback plan (if framework choice becomes problematic) conceptually understood.
- [ ] Results evaluated after 2 weeks.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured (N/A for foundational setup)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (initial setup)
- [ ] Tests written (unit tests for core components/utilities)
- [ ] Documentation updated (initial design system documentation)
- [ ] QA validation passed (basic functionality and UI consistency)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for initial app)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (initial setup time)

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Time to complete initial setup (login, dashboard); time to implement a subsequent small feature using the new system.
- **Target**: Initial setup within 5 days. Next small feature takes <= 2 days.
- **Measured via**: Developer time tracking, qualitative feedback on development speed.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 2 weeks from completion of this initial setup.
- **If successful**: Confirm that Shadcn/React foundation is effective for rapid development and consistency. Update belief that this foundation contributes to speed and intuitiveness.
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in product/beliefs/history.md and document learnings, re-evaluate UI framework/design system approach.

## Dependencies
