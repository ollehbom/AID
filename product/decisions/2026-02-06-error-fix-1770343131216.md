## Overview
This experiment aims to establish the foundational user interface and authentication for the product by creating a React app styled with Shadcn UI, implementing Google login, and a basic dashboard.

## Hypothesis
As a product team,
I believe that implementing a basic React app with Shadcn UI, Google login, and a foundational design system
Will result in a functional MVP that can be used by technically competent users and enable rapid iteration for testing core product beliefs
Because a modern, interactive interface and secure authentication are prerequisites for any user interaction.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: This foundational work enables the testing of existing core beliefs, such as "The primary user is technically competent," by providing the necessary platform. It implicitly supports the belief that users expect a modern, intuitive interface.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application interface; all interactions are currently non-existent or manual.
- **Pain Point**: Inability to onboard users, conduct user testing, or provide any interactive product experience.
- **Success Metric**: Functional React app, working Google login, accessible basic dashboard, and an established design system.
- **Reversibility**: While the core application foundation is not directly reversible via a feature flag, the modular nature of React components and design system allows for iterative changes and potential refactoring of specific UI choices or authentication providers in the future.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React app initialized and styled using Shadcn UI.
- [ ] Google login implemented and fully functional.
- [ ] A basic dashboard page is accessible post-login with mock content.
- [ ] Core design system components (e.g., buttons, forms, typography) are defined and documented.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable for specific sub-components)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (from Design Agent)
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage for core components)
- [ ] Documentation updated (e.g., README, design system documentation)
- [ ] QA validation passed
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (for production deployment)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (n/a for foundational existence)

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Existence and functionality of the core React application, Google login, basic dashboard, and defined design system.
- **Target**: 100% functionality and adherence to initial design specifications.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing, functional checks, and code review.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days post-deployment to confirm stability and functionality.
- **If successful**: Product foundation established, proceed with further experiments on user-facing features.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate foundational choices (e.g., UI library, authentication strategy, overall architecture).
