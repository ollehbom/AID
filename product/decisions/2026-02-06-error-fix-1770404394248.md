## Overview

Establish the foundational React application, including a modern UI with Shadcn, Google login functionality, a basic dashboard, and an initial design system to enable future product development.

## Hypothesis

As a future product user
I believe a modern, consistent UI with easy login and a basic dashboard
Will result in an intuitive initial experience and a strong base for future features
Because it aligns with our belief that the product must feel obvious and will accelerate development.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: The product must feel obvious without documentation
- **Current Workflow**: N/A (new product foundation)
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a core UI/UX foundation prevents user interaction and subsequent feature development.
- **Success Metric**: Functional React app with Shadcn, Google login, basic dashboard, and initial design system components.
- **Reversibility**: Core UI is foundational, but individual components are modular and can be iterated upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React app initialized and styled with Shadcn.
- [ ] Google login integrated and functional.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page accessible post-login with mock content.
- [ ] Initial design system components (e.g., buttons, inputs, typography) defined and implemented.
- [ ] Success metric tracked: Functionality of core UI, login, dashboard, and design system.
- [ ] Rollback plan tested: N/A for foundational build; iteration is the primary mechanism.
- [ ] Results evaluated after 7 days.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium`
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature flag configured: N/A (core foundation)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (from Design Agent)
- [ ] Tests written (≥85% coverage for core components)
- [ ] Documentation updated (initial README, component docs)
- [ ] QA validation passed (basic functionality)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready: N/A (initial build)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured: N/A (new foundation)

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Functional core React application, Google login, basic dashboard, and initial design system.
- **Target**: 100% functionality as described.
- **Measured via**: Manual verification and integration tests.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days from start of implementation.
- **If successful**: Update belief to "Core" in product/beliefs/current.md (if relevant new belief emerges, or reinforce existing ones).
- **If unsuccessful**: Document learnings and re-evaluate foundational approach.

## Dependencies

- Blocked by: N/A
