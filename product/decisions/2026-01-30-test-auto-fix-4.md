## Overview
Establish the foundational React application with a modern UI, Google login, and a basic dashboard to enable future product development and experimentation, aligning with the founder's vision for an intuitive product.

## Hypothesis
As a technical founder (and future user)
I believe a foundational React app with a modern UI (shadcn), Google login, and a basic dashboard
Will result in a stable and intuitive platform for rapid iteration and belief validation
Because it aligns with the founder's vision and core belief that the product must feel obvious without documentation.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: The product must feel obvious without documentation. (This foundational work supports this belief by setting up an intuitive UI framework from the outset.)
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application or foundational UI. Product development is currently blocked without a basic platform.
- **Pain Point**: Inability to test user hypotheses or gather feedback without a basic, deployable application. Lack of a consistent design system for future UI.
- **Success Metric**: A deployable React application with functional Google login and a basic dashboard, styled with shadcn/ui.
- **Reversibility**: The choice of React and shadcn/ui are foundational technology decisions, not an experiment to be reversed. Individual components built on this framework can be iterated or replaced.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Functional deployment, Google login working, basic dashboard present, and initial shadcn/ui integration evident.
- **Target**: 100% implementation of specified foundational components and styling.
- **Measured via**: QA and founder review upon initial deployment.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate within 7 days of development start.
- **If successful**: Proceed to the next stage of design and feature development, enabling subsequent belief validation experiments.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the foundational approach, potentially consulting with the founder on alternative technologies or scope adjustments.
