## Overview

This decision defines an experiment to establish the foundational user interface for the application, focusing on user access and an initial landing experience using Shadcn/UI.

## Hypothesis

As a technically competent user, I believe that implementing a simple Google login and a basic dashboard (with mock content) styled with Shadcn/UI will provide an obvious and intuitive entry point to the application, enabling me to begin using the product without guidance.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**:
    - `Core`: "The primary user is technically competent" - This experiment targets their initial interaction.
    - `Core`: "The product must feel obvious without documentation" - The design aims to support this.
    - `Open / Unproven`: "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" - This experiment will validate an initial part of the onboarding.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing UI for users to access the application.
- **Pain Point**: Users cannot log in or access any part of the application, preventing interaction with core product functionality.
- **Success Metric**: High percentage of successful Google logins and users reaching the basic dashboard.
- **Reversibility**: While core UI components are foundational, the specific design choices and content within the dashboard are iterative and can be adjusted. The choice of Shadcn/UI can be re-evaluated if significant issues arise, but changing the core UI framework has high effort.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (estimated 4-7 days for core implementation, not including full design system setup)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**:
    1. Percentage of internal testers successfully completing Google login.
    2. Percentage of logged-in internal testers successfully navigating to the basic dashboard.
- **Target**:
    1. 100% successful Google login rate during internal testing.
    2. 100% of logged-in users successfully reach the dashboard.
- **Measured via**: Manual testing and basic application logs.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate results within 7 days of initial internal deployment.
- **If successful**: Update belief regarding initial onboarding intuition and foundational UI choice. Proceed with Design Agent for detailed design of dashboard features.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate login method, UI library choice, or initial dashboard content/structure. Archive learnings in product/beliefs/history.md.
