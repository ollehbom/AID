## Overview\n\nThis decision outlines the plan to establish the foundational React application, integrating `shadcn/ui`, a Google login, and a basic dashboard, along with an initial design system. This forms the essential UI/UX groundwork for the product.\n\n## Hypothesis\n\nAs a product team, we believe that implementing a modern, `shadcn/ui`-based React application with core authentication and a basic dashboard, alongside a foundational design system, will accelerate future feature development and ensure a consistent, intuitive user experience, thereby supporting the core belief that 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' for our technically competent users.\n\n## Context\n\n- **Affected Belief**: This experiment supports the core beliefs "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and "Users value speed over configurability" by providing a robust and intuitive foundation.\n- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing unified frontend application or design system.\n- **Pain Point**: Lack of a consistent, modern UI framework and a standardized component library for rapid development.\n- **Success Metric**: Founder's qualitative approval of the initial application and design system, positive feedback from developers regarding the utility and ease of use of the design system.\n- **Reversibility**: As foundational work, direct rollback is not feasible. However, the design system is iterative and can be evolved or replaced in future stages if deemed necessary.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] React application initialized with `shadcn/ui` integration.\n- [ ] Google login functionality implemented and tested.\n- [ ] Basic dashboard page accessible post-login with mock content.\n- [ ] Initial design system guidelines documented (e.g., color palette, typography, spacing, basic component usage).\n- [ ] Founder review and approval obtained.\n\n## Experiment Scope\n\n- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)\n- **Component**: `frontend`\n- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] Code implemented for React app, `shadcn/ui` integration, Google login, and dashboard.\n- [ ] Tests written for key functionalities (e.g., login flow).\n- [ ] Initial design system documentation created.\n- [ ] QA validation passed for core functionalities.\n- [ ] Founder review completed.\n\n## Success Evaluation\n\n- **Metric**: Qualitative founder satisfaction, developer adoption/feedback on design system.\n- **Target**: High founder satisfaction, positive developer feedback on system utility and consistency within 2 weeks of implementation.\n- **Measured via**: Direct feedback and team discussions.\n- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 2 weeks post-initial implementation.\n- **If successful**: The foundational UI/UX approach and design system will be established as a core practice, enabling faster future development.\n- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen UI framework and design system approach, potentially exploring alternatives or simplifying further.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Blocked by: None\n- Blocks: Future UI/UX related feature development\n- Related belief: "The product must feel obvious without documentation"\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- Experiment tracking: `experiments/active.md`\n- Design intent: (will be created by Design Agent)
