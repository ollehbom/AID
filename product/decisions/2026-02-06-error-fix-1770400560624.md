# Decision: Implement Foundational React App and Design System (error-fix-1770400560624)

**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Feature ID:** error-fix-1770400560624

## Overview

This decision outlines the foundational work to establish a modern React application with a consistent design system, including a login screen and a basic dashboard. This is a critical enabling step to support future feature development and validate core product beliefs.

## Context

Founder feedback indicates a need to build the initial application shell with modern standards, a robust design system (shadcn), Google login, and a dashboard. This is not a direct user feature experiment but a prerequisite for all subsequent user-facing development.

### Analysis Framework Application:

1.  **Who's the User?**
    *   **Immediate:** Developers who will build on this foundation.
    *   **Ultimate:** The end-users of the product, who will interact with the UI.
    *   **Role:** Technical founders, future customers.
    *   **Skill Level:** Primary user is technically competent (as per current beliefs).
    *   **Frequency:** Daily interaction for developers, potentially daily for end-users.

2.  **What Problem Are They Solving?**
    *   **Current Workflow:** No existing application or consistent UI/UX framework.
    *   **Pain Point:** Lack of a unified design system and basic application structure leads to inconsistent user experience, slow development cycles for future features, and potential difficulty in conveying product value.
    *   **Time/Cost:** Building each component from scratch without a design system is inefficient and costly in the long run.

3.  **How Do We Measure Success?**
    *   **Metric:** Completion of specified foundational components, readiness for subsequent feature development, adherence to modern design standards (e.g., shadcn implementation).
    *   **Target:** A fully functional React application shell with Google login, a basic dashboard, and an extensible design system.
    *   **Timeline:** Completion of foundational elements within a defined sprint/milestone (e.g., 2-3 weeks).

4.  **Which Belief Does This Affect?**
    *   This foundational work directly supports and enables testing of our core beliefs:
        *   "The product must feel obvious without documentation": A strong design system and consistent UI contribute to intuitiveness.
        *   "Users value speed over configurability": A well-designed, modern UI often feels faster and more efficient.
        *   "The primary user is technically competent": Even technically competent users benefit from a clear, uncluttered interface.
    *   This initiative is considered a "belief-validation" enabler, establishing the environment where these beliefs can be upheld and tested through future features.

## Hypothesis (Foundational)

As a new user, I believe a modern, consistent React application built with a robust design system (shadcn), featuring a clear login and dashboard, will provide a foundational experience that feels intuitive, efficient, and aligns with our core product beliefs, enabling faster and more consistent future feature development.

## Experiment Scope

*   **Size**: `size: medium` (initial setup, design system integration, core components)
*   **Component**: `frontend`
*   **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp` (establishing the core application shell)

## Success Evaluation

*   **Metric**: Functional React app, consistent UI elements based on shadcn, successful Google login, accessible mock dashboard, clear and extensible design system structure.
*   **Target**: All specified foundational elements are implemented, tested, and ready for the next stage of feature development.
*   **Measured via**: Code review, QA validation, readiness for Design Agent handoff.
*   **Timeline**: To be evaluated upon completion of the initial implementation phase (e.g., within 2-3 weeks).
*   **If successful**: The product foundation is solid, enabling efficient future development.
*   **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate design system choice, implementation strategy, or scope.

## Reversibility

While a complete design system refactor is a significant undertaking, the initial implementation will prioritize modularity to allow for component-level changes or potential future system migration with minimized impact. This is a foundational investment rather than a reversible experiment in the traditional sense, but design choices will consider future adaptability.

## Dependencies

*   **Next Stage**: Design Agent for detailed UI/UX flows and component specifications based on the design system.
