## Overview
This decision outlines the foundational experiment to establish the core React application, integrate a modern design system (Shadcn UI), and implement a basic Google login flow leading to a mock dashboard.

## Hypothesis
As a **new user (technical founder)**,
I believe **implementing a consistent UI/UX foundation using Shadcn and a straightforward Google login/dashboard**
Will result in **an intuitive and robust starting point for product interaction and future development efficiency**
Because **this validates the core belief that the product must feel obvious without documentation and provides a platform to test onboarding intuitiveness.**

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: This experiment directly relates to the core belief "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and aims to validate the "Open / Unproven" belief "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance."
- **Current Workflow**: There is no current application workflow or user interface. Users cannot interact with the product.
- **Pain Point**: The absence of a basic application shell, login, and dashboard prevents any user interaction, hindering validation of core product ideas and delaying further feature development.
- **Success Metric**: Successful Google login rate, consistent UI element usage (Shadcn), and positive founder feedback on intuitiveness and aesthetics.
- **Reversibility**: Frontend changes are generally reversible. The feature can be rolled back by reverting code changes or by not deploying if initial feedback is negative.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React application initialized and styled with Shadcn UI
- [ ] Google login implemented and functional
- [ ] Basic dashboard page rendered with mock content after successful login
- [ ] UI elements (buttons, forms, layout) consistently use Shadcn components
- [ ] Founder feedback gathered on the initial look, feel, and login experience

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature flag configured (if any specific dashboard features are introduced later, but not for core app shell)
- [ ] Code implemented per design spec (as interpreted from Shadcn integration)
- [ ] Tests written (unit tests for components, integration tests for login flow)
- [ ] Documentation updated (e.g., README for setup instructions)
- [ ] QA validation passed (manual testing of login and dashboard rendering)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan ready (N/A for first foundational release)
- [ ] Success metric baseline captured (e.g., initial login success rate)

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Successful Google login rate, consistency of UI components with Shadcn guidelines, qualitative founder feedback.
- **Target**: 100% successful Google logins in testing; consistent Shadcn usage for all implemented UI elements; positive qualitative feedback from the founder on the initial experience.
- **Measured via**: Frontend logs for login success, visual inspection, direct founder interview.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 7 days post-implementation/deployment.
- **If successful**: Update belief "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance" to "Core" or refine based on specific insights; reinforce "The product must feel obvious without documentation."
- **If unsuccessful**: Archive in product/beliefs/history.md and document learnings, iterate on login flow or UI framework.
