## Overview
This decision initiates the development of the product's foundational UI, including a React app with shadcn/ui integration, Google login, and a basic dashboard.

## Hypothesis
As a developer, I believe implementing a shadcn/ui React app with Google login and a basic dashboard will result in a rapid foundation for feature development and a consistent, intuitive user experience because it establishes a robust and modern design system upfront.

## Context
- **Affected Belief**: This experiment reinforces the belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by establishing a strong, consistent design system. It also implicitly supports "Users value speed over configurability" by enabling faster UI development.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no existing application UI or authentication system.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a visual foundation, a secure authentication mechanism, and a starting point for building user-facing features.
- **Success Metric**: A deployed, functional React application with working Google login, a basic dashboard, and a clearly established design system.
- **Reversibility**: While the core tech stack choice is foundational, individual components and future features built upon this system will be designed for reversibility (e.g., via feature flags). Should this foundational approach prove untenable, a strategic pivot would be required.

## Experiment Scope
- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation
- **Metric**: Functional React app, successful Google login, basic dashboard rendering, and documented design system setup.
- **Target**: 100% implementation and functionality of the specified foundational elements.
- **Measured via**: Manual verification and developer testing.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of the initial implementation phase (estimated 1 week).
- **If successful**: This validates the chosen tech stack and design approach for the product's UI foundation, strengthening the belief in the importance of a robust design system for intuitive user experiences.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen UI framework or architectural approach.
