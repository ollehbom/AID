## Overview

This decision defines the initial technical foundation for the product: a React application using shadcn/ui for styling, integrated with Google login, and featuring a basic dashboard with mock content. This also initiates the implementation of a modern design system.

## Hypothesis

As a development team,
I believe establishing a modern React app with shadcn/ui, Google login, and a foundational design system
Will result in faster iteration and a consistent user experience for future experiments
Because this provides a robust and extensible UI platform to rapidly build and test user-facing features.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: This effort supports "The primary user is technically competent" by building a modern platform for them, and "The product must feel obvious without documentation" by establishing consistent UI patterns. It also implicitly reinforces "Users value speed over configurability" by enabling faster development cycles.
- **Current Workflow**: There is no established UI application or design system. Development is currently ad-hoc or conceptual.
- **Pain Point**: Lack of a unified, modern, and extensible UI foundation for the product, leading to potential inconsistencies and slower development cycles for future features.
- **Success Metric**: Developer satisfaction with the design system's utility and speed, successful Google authentication, and a functional, extensible basic dashboard.
- **Reversibility**: The core framework and design system choice is a foundational decision for a new application. Reversibility is high in the early stages if the chosen stack proves unsuitable, as minimal user-facing features would be built upon it. Individual components can be refactored or replaced.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core React application initialized with shadcn/ui.
- [ ] Google authentication implemented and functional.
- [ ] Basic dashboard page rendering with mock content.
- [ ] Initial design system components and utilities integrated (e.g., button, input, layout components from shadcn).
- [ ] Ability to easily add new components following the established design patterns.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Core React app repository created and initialized.
- [ ] shadcn/ui configured and example components rendering.
- [ ] Google OAuth integrated and tested.
- [ ] Basic dashboard route and component displaying mock data.
- [ ] Initial design system documentation/guidelines for component usage.
- [ ] Tests written for core authentication flow.
- [ ] QA validation passed for login and dashboard display.

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Developer feedback on ease of use of the design system, successful Google logins, functional basic dashboard.
- **Target**: High developer satisfaction with the UI foundation (e.g., 8/10 on a qualitative scale), 100% success rate for Google logins, basic dashboard loads and displays mock content without errors.
- **Measured via**: Qualitative feedback from developers, basic functional testing.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after 1 week of initial development and review.
- **If successful**: The UI foundation becomes "Core" in our product development process, enabling rapid feature development.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the choice of UI framework, design system approach, or authentication method.

## Dependencies

- Blocked by: None
- Blocks: All future UI-dependent features and experiments.
- Related belief: Foundational UI enables rapid iteration (implicit new belief).
