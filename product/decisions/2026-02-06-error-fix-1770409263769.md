## Overview

Decision to establish a foundational React application using shadcn/UI, Google login, and a basic dashboard to provide a modern, extensible UI base for future product development.

## Hypothesis

As a technically competent user, I believe a modern React application with a consistent design system (shadcn/UI), a clear login flow (Google), and a basic dashboard will provide a fast, intuitive, and extensible foundation, which will allow us to quickly build and test user-facing features that align with our core beliefs.

## Context

- **Affected Belief**: Core belief: "Users value speed over configurability", "The primary user is technically competent", "The product must feel obvious without documentation". This experiment validates the foundation aligned with these beliefs.
- **Current Workflow**: We currently lack a modern, standardized frontend application base.
- **Pain Point**: Difficulty in rapidly prototyping and building new user-facing features without a consistent design system and authentication mechanism.
- **Success Metric**: A functional React application with integrated shadcn/UI, working Google login, and a basic dashboard. Readiness for subsequent feature development.
- **Reversibility**: While the core framework choice is a significant commitment, the specific content and components are reversible. The setup will be behind a feature branch initially.

## Experiment Scope

- **Size**: `size: medium` (4-7 days)
- **Component**: `frontend`
- **Phase**: `phase-1-mvp`

## Success Evaluation

- **Metric**: Existence and functionality of the core application components (login, dashboard, shadcn integration).
- **Target**: 100% of specified components are functional and integrated.
- **Measured via**: Manual verification and readiness for the next development stage.
- **Timeline**: Evaluate upon completion of the initial setup (approx. 1 week).
- **If successful**: The foundational UI is established, enabling faster iteration on user-facing features. This reinforces our core beliefs.
- **If unsuccessful**: Re-evaluate the chosen tech stack or approach for establishing the UI foundation. Archive learnings.
