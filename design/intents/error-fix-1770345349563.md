This foundational feature establishes the core application infrastructure, enabling the development of subsequent product capabilities. It integrates a modern, opinionated design system (shadcn/ui) and secure Google authentication to deliver an initial, deployable user experience. The primary purpose is to create a robust and intuitive starting point that embodies our core belief: "The product must feel obvious without documentation." By providing a well-structured and visually consistent base, we aim to accelerate future feature development and validation.Users should experience a sense of modernity, clarity, and effortlessness. The application should feel intuitive and predictable, requiring no explicit guidance for navigation or interaction. The Google login process should instill trust and familiarity, leveraging established patterns. Post-authentication, the basic dashboard should feel clean, organized, and inviting, serving as a clear and unambiguous entry point to the product's functionality. Overall, the experience should be responsive and professional, reflecting a high standard of craftsmanship.The guiding principles include: 1. Obviousness: Every interaction, from login to dashboard navigation, must be self-explanatory. Users should instinctively know what to do next without hesitation. 2. Consistency: Leverage shadcn/ui to ensure a uniform visual language, interaction patterns, and component behavior across the entire application. This minimizes cognitive load and builds predictability. 3. Simplicity: Prioritize essential elements and interactions, avoiding clutter or unnecessary complexity. The initial dashboard should be lean and focused. 4. Feedback & Responsiveness: Provide clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., button states, loading indicators) to ensure users understand the system's status. The UI should feel snappy and reactive. 5. Security & Trust: Implement Google OAuth in a way that feels secure and familiar, reassuring users about the protection of their data.This feature directly addresses the user's need for a secure and straightforward entry point into the application. It provides a reliable authentication method (Google Login) and a clear, modern dashboard as their home base. Fundamentally, it fulfills the need for a functional and aesthetically pleasing initial product experience that sets the stage for future value delivery without creating early friction or confusion.
