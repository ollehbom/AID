# Design Intent: Core Application UI (error-fix-1770401149750)Why does this feature exist?This feature exists to establish the foundational user experience for our product. Currently, there is no visual interface for users to interact with, hindering any form of user engagement or validation of our core product beliefs. The primary goal is to provide a secure and intuitive entry point into the application through Google login and to present a basic dashboard, enabling users to access core views and begin interacting with the system. This directly addresses the critical need to move beyond conceptual product definitions to a tangible, interactive experience.How should it feel to users?The core application UI should feel **obvious**, **intuitive**, and **effortless** from the very first interaction. Users, particularly new ones, should be able to predict what happens next without hesitation or confusion. The experience should convey a sense of **modernity** and **trustworthiness**, given the use of a modern design system and Google login. There should be no friction in the login process, and the initial dashboard view should clearly communicate its purpose and available actions, fostering a sense of immediate productivity and clarity.What principles guide the interaction?1.  **Obviousness over Documentation**: Adhering to the core belief that "the product must feel obvious without documentation," every interaction, especially login and initial navigation, must be self-explanatory. Users should never feel lost or require external guidance.2.  **Simplicity & Clarity**: The interface should be minimalist, focusing only on essential elements for login and core dashboard views. Unnecessary complexity or cognitive load must be avoided.3.  **Efficiency**: The user journey from landing page to successful login and dashboard access should be swift and direct, minimizing steps and maximizing immediate value.4.  **Consistency**: Leveraging a modern design system (Shadcn UI) ensures a consistent visual language and interaction patterns, building familiarity and predictability across the application.5.  **Trust & Security**: The integration of Google login should instill confidence in data security and provide a familiar, reliable authentication method.What user needs does it address?This feature primarily addresses the following user needs:1.  **Secure Access**: Users need a secure and straightforward method to log into the application.2.  **Initial Orientation**: Users need to understand the product's purpose and how to interact with it from the outset, without needing to consult documentation.3.  **Core Interaction**: Users need to access the foundational views and functionalities of the application to begin their journey and validate its utility.4.  **Predictable Experience**: Technically competent users expect a smooth, modern, and predictable digital experience that respects their time and cognitive effort.
