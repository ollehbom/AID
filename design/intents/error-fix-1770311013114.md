The primary intent of this design is to establish a foundational, intuitive, and efficient initial user experience for technically competent users. This feature exists to create the core entry point into the application, ensuring a seamless onboarding flow that aligns with modern web standards and our core belief in minimal friction. The user should feel that the application is immediately accessible, trustworthy, and easy to navigate without needing external guidance or documentation. The interaction principles guiding this design are simplicity, clarity, and efficiency, focusing on making the Google login process straightforward and the subsequent dashboard access immediate and self-explanatory. This addresses the user's need for a quick and understandable initial setup, allowing them to engage with the product's core functionality without cognitive overhead. The design aims to reinforce the belief that 'the product must feel obvious without documentation' and to validate the 'onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance' hypothesis by presenting a clean, predictable, and modern interface from the very first interaction.
