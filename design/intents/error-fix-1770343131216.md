This feature exists to establish the foundational user interface, authentication mechanism, and a basic dashboard for the product's Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It addresses the critical need to provide an interactive and secure platform, enabling user onboarding, initial user testing, and the validation of core product beliefs where no such interface previously existed. It serves as the essential bedrock upon which all future product features and experiments will be built.Users should feel that the application is modern, intuitive, and secure. The experience should be frictionless, allowing technically competent users to quickly access and understand the core functionality without needing extensive guidance. It should evoke confidence in the application's stability and professional presentation.The interaction principles guiding this design are:1.  **Obviousness**: The UI should be self-explanatory, requiring no documentation for fundamental actions like login and initial navigation.2.  **Clarity & Simplicity**: Reduce cognitive load by presenting clear, direct options, especially for core actions like authentication.3.  **Speed & Efficiency**: Prioritize direct access and quick completion of tasks, such as a fast Google login process, avoiding unnecessary steps or complex configurations.4.  **Competence Assumption**: The design assumes a technically competent user, allowing for a streamlined interface without over-simplification.5.  **Foundational**: The design must be robust and extensible, forming a solid base for future iterations and feature additions, leveraging a consistent design system (Shadcn UI).This feature addresses the user's fundamental needs for secure and straightforward access to the application, a clear entry point into the product experience, and a basic understanding of what the application offers immediately post-login. It also satisfies the implicit user expectation for a modern, professional, and responsive application interface.
