### Why does this feature exist?
This foundational feature exists to establish the core infrastructure of the product. It enables initial user authentication via Google login, provides a basic navigable dashboard, and lays the groundwork for a consistent user interface using a modern design system. It directly addresses the immediate need to provide a functional application for users to access and interact with, moving beyond the current state of having no product interface.

### How should it feel to users?
Users should experience a sense of **effortlessness** during the login process, feeling that authentication is quick, secure, and integrated. The overall application should feel **reliable** and **professional**, instilling trust through its modern aesthetic and consistent behavior. Crucially, the product must feel **obvious** without documentation, allowing new users to instinctively understand how to log in and navigate to their dashboard, aligning with a core product belief.

### What principles guide the interaction?
1.  **Clarity and Directness**: User interactions, especially login, should be unambiguous with clear calls to action. Avoid hidden functionalities or complex decision points.
2.  **Consistency**: Leverage the chosen design system rigorously to ensure a uniform look, feel, and behavior across all initial screens, building familiarity and reducing cognitive load.
3.  **Efficiency**: Streamline the user journey from landing page to dashboard. Minimize steps and leverage established patterns (like Google OAuth) to reduce friction.
4.  **Feedback**: Provide immediate and clear visual feedback for all user actions, whether successful (e.g., successful login, dashboard loaded) or unsuccessful (e.g., login errors).
5.  **Security Assurance**: The design should subtly convey security and trustworthiness, particularly around authentication, to build user confidence in handling their data.

### What user needs does it address?
-   **Access**: The fundamental need for users to gain entry to the product.
-   **Secure Identity**: Users need a secure and trusted method to authenticate and associate their identity with the application.
-   **Orientation**: Upon successful login, users require a clear sense of their current location within the application and what basic actions they can perform.
-   **Trust & Professionalism**: A well-designed, intuitive, and consistent initial experience builds early trust in the product's capabilities and the organization behind it.
-   **Foundation for Growth**: It provides a stable and predictable platform for developers to build upon, ensuring future features integrate seamlessly.
