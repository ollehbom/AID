### Why this feature exists:This foundational feature establishes the technical and experiential bedrock for all future user-facing development. Its primary purpose is to accelerate feature iteration, ensure a consistent user experience, and provide a robust, modern frontend application. By integrating a standardized UI library (shadcn UI) and a secure authentication mechanism (Google Login), we aim to reduce development overhead, improve developer velocity, and deliver a high-quality product from the outset. It addresses the current pain point of lacking a consistent design system and authentication, which would otherwise slow down development and risk an inconsistent user experience.### How it should feel to users:The application should feel **intuitive**, **consistent**, **efficient**, and **trustworthy**. Intuitive: Users should immediately understand how to navigate and interact with the application, especially the login process and the initial dashboard view, without needing external documentation or guidance. Consistent: All interactive elements, layouts, and visual styles should adhere to a unified design language, creating a predictable and harmonious experience across the application. Efficient: The login process should be quick and seamless, and the dashboard should load swiftly, allowing users to access their primary information without delay. Trustworthy: The use of Google Login should instill confidence in the security and reliability of their access, while a clean, professional UI reinforces the product's credibility.### What principles guide the interaction:1.  **Clarity & Obviousness**: Every interaction, from logging in to viewing the dashboard, must be self-explanatory. Ambiguity is to be avoided, aligning with the belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation."2.  **Consistency**: Adherence to shadcn UI's design system is paramount. This ensures a uniform look and feel, reducing cognitive load and improving learnability.3.  **Efficiency over Configurability**: Interactions should be streamlined and direct, prioritizing speed of access and task completion over extensive customization, echoing the belief that "Users value speed over configurability."4.  **Predictability**: Users should always be able to anticipate the outcome of their actions, fostering a sense of control and reducing frustration.### What user needs it addresses:This feature directly addresses the user's need for:Secure and Easy Access: A straightforward, reliable, and secure method to sign in and access the application (Google Login).A Clear Starting Point: A well-structured and easily understandable dashboard that serves as the user's initial entry point and overview.A Consistent and Professional Experience: An application that looks and behaves predictably, reflecting a high standard of quality and professionalism, which reduces friction and enhances usability.Implicitly, Rapid Feature Evolution: By laying a solid foundation, users will benefit from faster delivery of new, well-integrated features in the future.
