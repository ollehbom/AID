This foundational feature establishes the essential application shell, user authentication via Google Login, and a basic dashboard. Its primary purpose is to enable the very first user interaction with the product, providing a functional entry point for new users and a stable platform for subsequent feature development and validation. It addresses the critical pain point of having no existing application to onboard users, test features, or demonstrate product value. The interaction should feel modern, intuitive, and remarkably fast. Users should perceive the product as robust, reliable, and professional from their very first click. The process of signing in and accessing the dashboard should be seamless, requiring minimal cognitive effort and instilling confidence in the application's capabilities. It must feel obvious, requiring no external documentation or guidance. Key principles guiding the interaction include Obviousness & Simplicity (clear path from landing to dashboard), Speed & Efficiency (quick loading, streamlined Google Login), Consistency & Modernity (strict adherence to Shadcn UI), Trust & Security (secure Google authentication), and Immediate Value (functional dashboard post-login). This feature addresses the user's fundamental need to securely access the product quickly and without confusion, providing a clear entry point and fulfilling the belief that the product must feel obvious and value speed.
