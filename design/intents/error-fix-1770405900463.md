### Why this feature exists:This feature establishes the foundational user interface for the product, enabling future user-facing experiments and interactions. It transitions the product from a backend/CLI-only interaction model to a fully accessible graphical interface. This is a critical enabling step to gather user feedback, validate core product beliefs, and unblock subsequent feature development.

### How it should feel to users:
*   **Obvious and Intuitive**: Users should immediately understand how to log in and navigate to the dashboard without confusion, external documentation, or guidance. The process should feel natural and self-explanatory.
*   **Fast and Responsive**: The application should load quickly, and interactions, particularly the login flow, should be swift, minimizing waiting times and perceived friction.
*   **Clean and Professional**: Leveraging `shadcn/ui`, the interface should present a modern, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing experience that instills confidence in the product's quality and maturity.
*   **Secure**: The Google login process should feel trustworthy and secure, reassuring users about the protection of their credentials and data.

### What principles guide the interaction:
*   **Minimalism**: Only essential information and actions are presented at each step, reducing cognitive load and avoiding clutter.
*   **Clarity over Density**: Every UI element and piece of copy must have a clear purpose and be easily understandable.
*   **Direct Path**: The user journey from landing page to logged-in dashboard should be as direct and frictionless as possible.
*   **Consistency**: Adherence to `shadcn/ui` patterns and established visual language ensures a predictable and familiar experience.
*   **Feedback**: Clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., loading states during login) provides reassurance and indicates system responsiveness.

### What user needs it addresses:
*   **Access**: Provides a simple, secure, and intuitive method for users to gain access to the application.
*   **Clarity**: Offers an initial clear understanding of the product's existence and purpose, even with placeholder content on the dashboard.
*   **Trust**: Establishes trust through a recognized and secure login mechanism (Google OAuth) and a professional-looking interface.
*   **Foundation for Future Interaction**: While not directly solving a specific user problem at this stage, it lays the essential groundwork for all subsequent features that *will* address user needs, making the product tangible and testable.
