# Design Intent: Foundational MVP (Login & Dashboard)

## Why this feature exists?
This foundational MVP exists to establish a robust, modern, and extensible technical and UI base for the product. It addresses the critical need for a functional application to begin rapid feature development and user testing. By implementing a React application with Shadcn UI, Google authentication, and a basic dashboard, we aim to provide an intuitive initial user experience that aligns with current best practices and enables quick validation of core product ideas.

## How should it feel to users?
The user experience should feel **obvious, fast, and secure**. Users, primarily technically competent individuals, should immediately understand how to log in and navigate the basic dashboard without needing documentation or guidance. The interface should be clean, modern, and highly responsive, reflecting the value we place on speed over configurability. The Google login experience should instill confidence and trustworthiness.

## What principles guide the interaction?
1.  **Simplicity & Clarity**: Prioritize essential functions and information, minimizing cognitive load. Every interaction should be straightforward and predictable.
2.  **Efficiency**: Streamline the user journey, particularly for core actions like login and accessing the dashboard.
3.  **Consistency**: Leverage the foundational design system (Shadcn UI) to ensure a uniform look and behavior across all elements, fostering familiarity.
4.  **Feedback**: Provide clear and immediate feedback for user actions, especially during the login process and navigation.
5.  **Intent-Driven Design**: The UI must directly reflect the product's purpose and user's immediate goals, making the next step always apparent.

## What user needs does it address?
This MVP addresses the user's fundamental need to:
-   **Access the product**: Through a reliable and familiar authentication method (Google login).
-   **Understand the product's core value proposition**: By providing a clear entry point into the application (dashboard).
-   **Experience a modern and intuitive interface**: Catering to technically competent users who expect high-quality software.
-   **Feel confident in the application's stability and security**: Establishing trust from the very first interaction.

This serves as the bedrock upon which all future features and experiments will be built, ensuring a consistent and high-quality user experience from the outset.
