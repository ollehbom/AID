The "gh-vs-4" feature establishes the foundational user interface for the product, focusing on a secure and intuitive entry point via Google login and a basic dashboard. Its primary existence is to translate the core product belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation" into a tangible user experience, and to validate the "Open / Unproven" belief that "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance." This initial UI provides the critical platform for future feature development and user interaction, addressing the current pain point of having no application workflow.Users should feel a sense of immediate clarity, modern professionalism, and effortless security. The experience should be straightforward, requiring no prior instruction or mental effort to understand how to log in and navigate to the dashboard. It should instill confidence in the product's robustness and attention to user experience from the very first interaction.Principles guiding this interaction include:Obviousness: Every element and action should be self-explanatory, eliminating the need for documentation or guesswork.Consistency: Leveraging Shadcn UI ensures a cohesive and predictable visual language, reinforcing familiarity and reducing cognitive load.Efficiency: The login process should be swift and direct, minimizing steps and friction.Feedback: Clear visual cues and messages will confirm successful actions or indicate issues, ensuring users are always informed.Trust: The use of Google login leverages a familiar and trusted authentication method, enhancing user confidence in data security.This feature addresses the user need for a simple, secure, and accessible entry point to the application. For technical founders, it provides an intuitive environment to begin exploring and validating product ideas without being bogged down by a complex or confusing setup. Ultimately, it lays the groundwork for a scalable and user-centric product experience.
