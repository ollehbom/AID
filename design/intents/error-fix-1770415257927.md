### Why This Feature Exists?
This feature establishes the foundational frontend of the application, addressing the critical need for a functional user interface, authentication system, and initial user entry point. It enables users to securely log in via Google OAuth and access a basic dashboard, thereby unblocking all subsequent feature development and user belief validation experiments. Its primary purpose is to transform the product's abstract beliefs into a tangible, interactive experience.
