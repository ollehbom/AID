This foundational feature exists to establish the core user interface and experience of our product, laying a robust groundwork for all subsequent development. Its primary objective is to embody our core belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation." By integrating `shadcn/ui` as our design system and implementing a functional Google login, we aim to resolve the current absence of a unified design language and a stable application structure.Users interacting with this initial setup should experience immediate understanding and effortless navigation. The flow from the login screen to the basic dashboard must be seamless and intuitive, requiring no guesswork or external instructions. The experience should feel modern, clean, and professional, instilling confidence in the application's quality and reliability from the very first interaction. There must be no ambiguity; every UI element, from buttons to input fields, and every transition should behave precisely as a technically competent user would anticipate.The interaction design is governed by several guiding principles. **Clarity and Simplicity** dictate that only essential elements are presented, eliminating any visual clutter that could distract or confuse. **Consistency** is paramount, ensuring that all UI components and interaction patterns strictly adhere to the `shadcn/ui` design system, thereby creating a predictable and unified experience across all screens. **Directness** ensures that user actions lead to immediate and understandable outcomes, with clear visual feedback provided for every interaction, such as loading states or successful authentication. Finally, the design prioritizes **Efficiency**, recognizing that our primary users are technically proficient and value speed over unnecessary configurability.Ultimately, this feature addresses the fundamental user needs for **Access** (a secure and straightforward entry point into the application), **Orientation** (a clear understanding of their current location and available actions within the dashboard), and **Trust** (a professional, consistent, and reliable interface that inspires confidence in the product's capabilities). It ensures that the initial user encounter is not merely functional, but a positive and empowering experience that reinforces our product's promise of being intuitive and powerful.
