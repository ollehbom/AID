### Design Intent: Foundational Application Setup (Feature ID: error-fix-1770402949355)#### Why does this feature exist?This foundational feature serves as the bedrock for all future product development and user interaction. Its primary purpose is to establish a robust, intuitive, and modern React application shell, integrating a consistent UI framework (shadcn/ui), secure Google login, and a basic dashboard. This is a critical prerequisite, addressing the current inability to build and test user-facing features due to the absence of a core application environment. By laying this foundation, we unblock the development pipeline and enable rapid iteration on future user needs and product beliefs.#### How should it feel to users?The interaction should feel **obvious, intuitive, and effortlessly modern**. Users, particularly our technically competent primary users, should perceive the application as **fast, responsive, and reliable** from their very first interaction. The use of shadcn/ui should convey a sense of **consistency and polished professionalism**, fostering trust and reducing cognitive load. The login process, powered by Google, must feel **secure, familiar, and frictionlessly integrated**. The basic dashboard should provide a **clear, uncluttered, and welcoming entry point**, giving users an immediate sense of orientation without overwhelming them with unnecessary complexity.#### What principles guide the interaction?1.  **Clarity and Simplicity**: Every element, from navigation to basic information display, must be immediately understandable. The product's core belief that it "must feel obvious without documentation" is paramount. We prioritize directness over excessive configurability, especially at this foundational stage.2.  **Consistency**: Leveraging shadcn/ui ensures a uniform design language across the application. This consistency reduces learning curves and builds user confidence, allowing them to predict interactions reliably.3.  **Efficiency and Responsiveness**: The application must be performant, loading quickly and responding to user input without delay. This aligns with the belief that "users value speed over configurability."4.  **Security and Trust**: The Google login integration must be implemented with best practices, reassuring users about the safety and privacy of their data.5.  **Scalability and Extensibility**: While basic, the design should be architected to easily accommodate future features and evolving user needs without requiring significant re-architecture or design overhauls.6.  **Empowerment of Competent Users**: Acknowledging that "the primary user is technically competent," the design can be clean and direct, avoiding overly simplistic or verbose explanations. It empowers users to quickly grasp and navigate the interface.#### What user needs does it address?This foundational setup addresses several critical user needs:-   **Secure and Easy Access**: Users need a straightforward and secure method to access the application, which Google login provides by leveraging an existing, trusted identity.-   **Clear Starting Point**: The basic dashboard offers an immediate point of orientation, allowing users to understand they have successfully entered the application and can begin their work.-   **Reliable and Predictable Environment**: Users need a stable and bug-free environment to interact with, reducing frustration and building confidence in the product.-   **Modern User Experience**: Users expect applications to be visually appealing, responsive, and follow contemporary UI/UX patterns. This foundation ensures we meet these expectations from day one.-   **Foundation for Value Delivery**: Ultimately, this feature enables the development and deployment of all subsequent features that will directly address the user's core problems and deliver product value.
