### Design Intent for Initial Core Application (error-fix-1770411297669)

This design intent document outlines the foundational principles and user experience goals for the initial build of our core React application, encompassing the Google login and basic dashboard.

#### Why does this feature exist?

The primary purpose of this feature is to establish a robust, modern, and intuitive foundation for our product. It addresses the critical need for a functional, visually coherent application that enables user interaction and provides a clear entry point to our value proposition. By integrating a modern design system (Shadcn UI), secure authentication via Google login, and a basic dashboard, we aim to deliver a strong first impression and set the stage for rapid, consistent feature development. It resolves the current pain point of having no functional application available to users or for internal testing.

#### How should it feel to users?

Users should experience a sense of immediate clarity, professionalism, and ease. The application should feel **obvious** and **effortless**, requiring no prior instruction or documentation to navigate. Interactions should be **fast** and **responsive**, reinforcing the belief that "users value speed over configurability." The visual aesthetic, powered by Shadcn UI, should convey a **modern, clean, and trustworthy** impression, ensuring a consistent and pleasant experience from the very first interaction.

#### What principles guide the interaction?

1.  **Obviousness over Explanation**: Every element, flow, and piece of information should be self-evident. Users should intuitively predict outcomes without needing explicit guidance, validating the belief that "the product must feel obvious without documentation."
2.  **Efficiency and Directness**: Interactions should be streamlined, minimizing steps and cognitive load. For example, the login process should be as direct as possible, prioritizing speed for our technically competent users.
3.  **Consistency and Predictability**: Leveraging Shadcn UI ensures a unified design language across all components. This predictability builds trust and reduces learning curves.
4.  **Clarity in Purpose**: The basic dashboard, even with mock content, must clearly communicate its purpose and potential value, guiding the user's attention to key areas.
5.  **Robustness and Trust**: Especially for authentication, the system must convey reliability and security.

#### What user needs does it address?

This foundational work addresses several critical user needs:
*   **Access to the product**: Providing a secure and straightforward method (Google login) to enter the application.
*   **Understanding of value**: Offering an initial glimpse into the product's capabilities through a well-structured, albeit basic, dashboard.
*   **A reliable and modern interface**: Meeting the expectation of a professional and up-to-date user experience that feels trustworthy.
*   **Ease of use**: Ensuring that the initial interactions are smooth and intuitive, reducing any friction for new users.

Ultimately, this feature serves as the bedrock for all future user interactions, ensuring a positive and productive starting point for our technically competent target audience.
