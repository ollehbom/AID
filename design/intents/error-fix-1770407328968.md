### Design Intent: Core UI Foundation

#### Why does this feature exist?
This foundational feature exists to establish the essential user interface for the product. Its primary purpose is to transition the product from an internal concept to a tangible, interactive experience that users can engage with. By providing a modern React application, integrated Google login, and a basic dashboard, it enables the product team to conduct user-facing experiments, validate core product beliefs, and gather crucial feedback on initial user interactions and onboarding flows. Without this foundation, direct user engagement and subsequent feature development are impossible.

#### How should it feel to users?
Users should experience a sense of immediate **obviousness** and **intuition**. The interface should feel inherently understandable, requiring no documentation or external guidance to navigate. The design should evoke a feeling of **modernity**, **cleanliness**, and **efficiency**, reflecting the technical competence of our primary users who value speed. The Google login process should feel **secure** and **seamless**, fostering trust from the outset. Overall, the experience should be **effortless** and **predictable**, allowing users to focus on the product's value rather than struggling with its interface.

#### What principles guide the interaction?
1.  **Obviousness & Predictability**: Every interaction, from login to dashboard navigation, should be predictable and self-evident, aligning with the core belief that "the product must feel obvious without documentation." New users must be able to predict what happens next.
2.  **Simplicity & Clarity**: Prioritize clear, uncluttered layouts and straightforward interaction paths. Avoid ambiguity and ensure that the purpose of each UI element is immediately apparent.
3.  **Consistency**: Leverage the Shadcn UI framework to ensure a consistent visual language, component behavior, and interaction patterns across the application, reinforcing familiarity and reducing cognitive load.
4.  **Efficiency**: Design for the technically competent user who values speed. Minimize unnecessary steps, clicks, or cognitive overhead, especially in core flows like onboarding.
5.  **Feedback & Responsiveness**: Provide clear, immediate visual feedback for all user actions, ensuring the system's state is always transparent.

#### What user needs does it address?
This feature addresses the fundamental user need for **access** to the product. It provides the initial entry point and a clear, intuitive path for users to begin interacting with the system. It caters to the need for a **trustworthy and professional experience**, establishing credibility through a modern and well-designed interface. Crucially, it fulfills the need for **efficient onboarding**, allowing technically competent users to quickly get started and perceive the product's value without friction or confusion.
