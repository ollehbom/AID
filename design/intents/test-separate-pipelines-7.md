# Design Intent: Initial React Application

## Purpose

This feature establishes the foundational user interface for the product. It prioritizes a functional login system (Google OAuth) and a basic dashboard to provide a starting point for future feature development. This initial build allows for rapid iteration and early user feedback.

## User Experience Goals

-   **Speed and Efficiency:** The user should quickly be able to log in and access a functional dashboard.
-   **Intuitive:** The interface should feel obvious and easy to navigate, even for new users.
-   **Visual Consistency:** Utilize Shadcn UI to establish a consistent look and feel across the application.

## Guiding Principles

-   **Simplicity:** Prioritize a clean, uncluttered design.
-   **Technical Proficiency:** Assume a technically competent user.
-   **Iterative:** Design for change, with the ability to easily swap UI components and iterate based on feedback.

## User Needs Addressed

-   **Access:** Provides secure user access via Google OAuth.
-   **Foundation:** Establishes a basic dashboard for future feature integration.
-   **Feedback Loop:** Enables rapid testing and feedback gathering.
