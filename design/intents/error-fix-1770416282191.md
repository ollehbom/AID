This feature establishes the core front-end foundation for the entire application, addressing the critical need for a consistent, modern, and "obvious" user interface. It implements essential components like Google login and a basic dashboard to enable initial user access and interaction. By integrating shadcn/ui, it lays the groundwork for a robust design system, accelerating future feature development and ensuring a cohesive user experience from day one. This directly supports the core product belief that "the product must feel obvious without documentation" by providing a self-explanatory entry point.The experience should feel effortless and intuitive. Users, particularly our technically competent primary audience, should perceive the UI as modern, clean, and professional. The login process must be frictionless and secure, instilling confidence. Once logged in, the dashboard should feel like a clear and welcoming home base, immediately conveying purpose and providing obvious pathways for further interaction without any sense of ambiguity or confusion.The following principles guide the interaction: 1. Obviousness by Design: Every element and interaction must be self-evident. No user should need instructions or documentation to understand how to log in or navigate the basic dashboard. 2. Consistency: Visuals, interaction patterns, and terminology will be consistent between the login and dashboard screens, setting a precedent for future features. 3. Clarity & Simplicity: Prioritize clear visual hierarchy and minimal cognitive load. Avoid unnecessary complexity or visual clutter. 4. Efficiency: Optimize for quick task completion, particularly for the login flow. 5. Feedback: Provide clear, immediate feedback for user actions and system states (e.g., loading, success, error).This design addresses the following user needs: 1. Secure Access: Users need a reliable and secure method to authenticate and access the application. 2. Clear Entry Point: After authentication, users require a straightforward "home" or dashboard to begin their work or explore product capabilities. 3. Confidence in the Platform: Technical users expect a well-engineered and aesthetically pleasing application, fostering trust and engagement. 4. Reduced Learning Curve: By making the initial experience obvious, it minimizes the time and effort required for users to become productive with the product.
