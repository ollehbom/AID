### Why this feature exists: This foundational feature serves as the bedrock for all future product development. Its primary purpose is to establish a modern, robust, and visually consistent technical and interaction base for our early-stage product. By implementing a React application with shadcn UI, functional Google login, and a basic dashboard, we aim to unblock immediate development, provide a tangible starting point for users, and validate our chosen technology stack for the frontend. It's about building the essential scaffolding so that subsequent features can be rapidly and consistently integrated. ### How it should feel to users: Users, particularly our target audience of technically competent individuals, should experience a sense of professionalism, reliability, and ease-of-use from their very first interaction. The application should feel intuitive and responsive, conveying that it is a well-engineered and thoughtfully designed product. The login process should be quick and seamless, and the dashboard should immediately provide a clear, uncluttered view, making the user feel in control and ready to proceed without confusion or friction. ### What principles guide the interaction: 1. Obviousness without Documentation: Aligning with the core belief "The product must feel obvious without documentation," all interactions, especially the login and initial dashboard view, must be self-explanatory. Users should instinctively know what to do next. 2. Clarity & Simplicity: The UI should be clean, direct, and free from unnecessary complexity. Every element should have a clear purpose, reducing cognitive load. 3. Consistency: Leveraging shadcn UI, a consistent design language will be applied across all foundational components. This ensures a predictable and harmonious user experience, reinforcing the professional feel. 4. Efficiency: The Google login flow should be optimized for speed, reflecting our belief that "Users value speed over configurability." Minimize steps and unnecessary delays. 5. Predictability: Users should be able to anticipate the outcome of their actions. For instance, clicking the login button should clearly lead to the Google authentication flow, and successful login should predictably land them on the dashboard. ### What user needs it addresses: - Seamless Access: Provides a straightforward and secure method (Google login) for users to gain entry to the application. - Clear Starting Point: Offers a basic, functional dashboard that serves as an immediate anchor and overview of the application's core functionality, addressing the need for orientation. - Trust & Confidence: A polished and responsive initial experience fosters user trust in the product's capabilities and future potential. - Reduced Friction: Minimizes barriers to entry and initial exploration, allowing technical users to quickly get started and assess the product's value.
