This foundational feature establishes the core frontend infrastructure for the product. Its primary purpose is to provide a modern, scalable, and consistent platform using React and Shadcn UI, enabling rapid iteration and validation of future user-facing features. It formalizes the belief that a robust frontend foundation is critical for accelerating product development.

**How it should feel to users:**
The initial experience should feel reliable, stable, and professional. Users should perceive the application as modern and aesthetically consistent, even in its basic form. The Google login process should be secure and frictionless, instilling trust. The dashboard, while basic, should feel responsive and intuitive, providing a clear entry point to the application without unnecessary complexity. Performance should be swift, reflecting a well-engineered foundation.

**What principles guide the interaction:**
1.  **Clarity & Obviousness:** The primary user (who is technically competent, per product beliefs) should intuitively understand how to log in and navigate the basic dashboard without needing documentation.
2.  **Consistency:** All UI elements adhere to the established design system, ensuring a cohesive and predictable experience from the outset.
3.  **Efficiency:** Streamlined authentication via Google Login minimizes steps and friction. The dashboard should load quickly and provide essential information efficiently.
4.  **Security:** Google authentication is implemented robustly to ensure user data protection and trust.
5.  **Scalability:** The design of core components and layouts anticipates future expansion, allowing new features to integrate seamlessly.

**What user needs it addresses:**
For the product owner/developer, it addresses the critical need for a stable, modern, and extensible platform to build and test new features rapidly. For the end-user (initially, likely technical users), it provides a secure, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing entry point into the application, ensuring a positive first impression and a solid base for future interactions.
