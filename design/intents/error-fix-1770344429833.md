This feature establishes the foundational user interface for our product, addressing the critical absence of a modern, consistent, and functional frontend. Its core purpose is to enable rapid iteration and seamless future feature development by implementing a React application with Shadcn UI, Google login, and a basic dashboard, alongside a core design system. The intent is to provide an intuitive, fast, and secure entry point for users, laying a robust groundwork for all subsequent interactions. Users should experience immediate obviousness and speed. The Google login process must feel secure and familiar, minimizing friction and building trust. Upon authentication, the basic dashboard should be clean, responsive, and self-explanatory, clearly communicating its purpose without requiring documentation. The overall interaction should feel efficient and professional, catering to our technically competent target audience. Guiding interaction principles include: 1. Obviousness: Interactions and visual elements must be immediately understandable, allowing users to predict outcomes without hesitation. The UI should naturally guide the user. 2. Speed over Configurability: Prioritize swift task completion and responsive feedback, minimizing steps and cognitive load, reflecting our belief in user efficiency. 3. Consistency: A foundational design system will ensure uniform visual and interactive patterns across all components, enhancing predictability and ease of learning. 4. Directness: Clear calls to action and immediate, unambiguous feedback for user actions are crucial. 5. Security and Trust: Leveraging Google login provides a universally recognized and trusted authentication mechanism, ensuring user confidence. This design directly addresses the user's need for secure product access, an intuitive entry point via a dashboard, and a consistent, modern user experience aligned with their technical proficiency. It creates a scalable, user-centric foundation for the product.
