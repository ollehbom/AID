## Design Intent: Foundational UI/UX (React App, Google Login, Dashboard, Design System)

### Why this feature exists?
This foundational feature establishes the essential user interface and experience groundwork for our product. Its primary purpose is to integrate a modern React application with `shadcn/ui`, implement robust Google login functionality, and create a basic, intuitive dashboard. Concurrently, it initiates our core design system. This work is critical to accelerate future feature development, ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience from day one, and directly address the current lack of a unified frontend framework and standardized component library. It serves as the bedrock upon which all subsequent UI/UX will be built.

### How should it feel to users?
The application should feel **obvious**, **modern**, **clean**, and **highly responsive**. Users, being technically competent, should immediately perceive a professional and reliable system. The login process should feel swift and secure, leveraging the familiarity of Google authentication. Upon entering the dashboard, users should experience a sense of clarity and organization, with essential information readily accessible. The overall interaction should be frictionless, instilling confidence and a feeling of effortless productivity.

### What principles guide the interaction?
1.  **Obviousness over Documentation**: In line with our core belief, every interaction, especially the login and dashboard navigation, must be intuitively understandable without external guidance. A new user should predict what happens next with ease.
2.  **Consistency & Familiarity**: By integrating `shadcn/ui` and our nascent design system, we ensure a consistent visual language and interaction patterns. The Google login leverages a globally recognized flow, enhancing familiarity and trust.
3.  **Efficiency & Speed**: The login flow must be streamlined. The dashboard should load quickly and provide immediate value, reflecting our belief that "Users value speed over configurability."
4.  **Clarity & Simplicity**: UI elements should be uncluttered and convey their purpose clearly. Information density on the dashboard should be balanced to prevent overwhelm.
5.  **Security & Trust**: The authentication process must clearly communicate its security, ensuring users feel safe sharing their credentials.

### What user needs does it address?
This feature addresses the fundamental user need for a secure, reliable, and intuitive entry point into the product. Users need a straightforward way to authenticate and gain immediate access to a core interface that provides an initial overview of the application's capabilities or their personal status. It lays the foundation for a positive long-term user experience by establishing consistency and ease of use from their very first interaction.
