### Purpose and Rationale
This feature establishes the core foundational UI for the entire application, leveraging `shadcn/ui` to create a robust, consistent, and intuitive user experience from the very first interaction. Its primary purpose is to provide a rapid and consistent initial development environment, enabling faster feature iteration and ensuring a clear visual language across the product. This foundation is critical for validating core product beliefs that prioritize speed, technical competency, and an obvious, documentation-free user experience. It addresses the immediate pain point of lacking a consistent UI framework and initial application structure.

### User Experience and Feel
The application, starting with the Google login and basic dashboard, should feel:
- **Familiar and Efficient**: For our primary technical users, the interface should align with modern web application conventions, making interactions predictable and quick.
- **Robust and Professional**: The visual design, powered by `shadcn/ui`, should convey reliability and a high standard of quality.
- **Intuitive and Obvious**: Users should be able to navigate and understand the purpose of each element without needing external guidance or documentation.
- **Clean and Performant**: The UI should be uncluttered, responsive, and load quickly, reflecting the product's emphasis on speed.

### Guiding Interaction Principles
1.  **Clarity**: Every UI element and interaction must have an immediately discernible purpose and outcome. Ambiguity is to be avoided.
2.  **Consistency**: Visual styles, component behaviors, and interaction patterns must remain uniform across the login flow and the dashboard. This ensures predictability and reduces cognitive load.
3.  **Efficiency**: The user journey, particularly for login, should be streamlined, minimizing unnecessary steps and providing direct access to core functionalities.
4.  **Discoverability**: Key actions and information should be easily found without active searching, supporting the belief that the product must feel obvious.
5.  **Responsiveness**: The interface should react promptly to user input, providing immediate feedback and a fluid experience.

### User Needs Addressed
-   **Secure and Easy Access**: Users need a straightforward and reliable method to log into the application (via Google OAuth).
-   **Clear Starting Point**: Upon login, users require a consistent and understandable dashboard that serves as their primary entry point to the application's features.
-   **Predictable Interaction**: Users expect an interface that behaves predictably, building trust and reducing frustration.
-   **Confidence in the Product**: A well-designed, professional-looking interface instills confidence in the application's overall quality and capabilities.
