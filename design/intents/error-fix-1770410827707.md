This feature establishes the foundational user interface for the product, focusing on implementing a modern design system, streamlined user login, and a basic, functional dashboard. Its primary purpose is to create a consistent, intuitive, and professional initial user experience that enables future user testing and validation of core product beliefs. The design aims to make the product feel 'obvious without documentation' from the very first interaction.Interaction principles guiding this design include:Clarity & Simplicity: Ensuring all critical paths, especially user login, are straightforward and require minimal steps.Consistency: Strict adherence to a modern design system (shadcn) across all visual components to deliver a unified and professional aesthetic.Efficiency: Prioritizing direct interaction and speed over extensive configurability, in line with the belief that 'Users value speed over configurability'.Predictability: Designing interactions so that users can easily anticipate the outcome of their actions, reinforcing the 'obvious without documentation' principle.Minimalism: Focusing on essential functionality and information, avoiding unnecessary complexity in this initial phase to reduce cognitive load.This design addresses the critical user need for a functional and visually consistent entry point into the product. It allows new users to register and access a basic dashboard, providing the necessary shell to begin interacting with the product. Furthermore, it ensures the product's initial presentation aligns with the expectations of our technically competent primary user base.
