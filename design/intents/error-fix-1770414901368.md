The primary intent of this design is to establish a robust, intuitive, and high-performance foundational user interface for the AI Pipeline application. This initial setup, encompassing the login screen and a basic dashboard, serves as the cornerstone for all future feature development. It directly addresses the product belief that 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' by presenting a clear and unambiguous entry point and a well-structured overview. It also supports 'Users value speed over configurability' by prioritizing a streamlined login process and a responsive, clean dashboard that minimizes cognitive load.

Users should feel a sense of immediate competence and efficiency when interacting with the application. The login experience, leveraging Google OAuth, should feel secure, swift, and trustworthy, requiring minimal effort. Upon successful login, the dashboard should convey professionalism, organization, and readiness for complex tasks, without overwhelming the technically competent user with unnecessary details or choices. The overall aesthetic, driven by Shadcn UI, should feel modern, consistent, and reliable, instilling confidence in the application's stability and future capabilities. The design aims to remove any friction from the very first interaction, setting a positive precedent for the user's journey within the AI Pipeline.
