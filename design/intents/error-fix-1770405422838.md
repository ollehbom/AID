This feature establishes the foundational React frontend application with a modern design system (shadcn), including core authentication and a basic dashboard. It exists to accelerate future feature development by providing a robust, consistent, and standardized UI foundation. This addresses the current lack of a common frontend framework, which leads to slow development, inconsistent user experiences, and increased technical debt. The application should feel reliable, modern, intuitive, and consistent to users. Interactions should be predictable and responsive, ensuring a smooth and efficient user journey from login onward. Key principles guiding the interaction include: clarity over complexity, ensuring UI elements and flows are straightforward; strict consistency with the shadcn design system for all visual and interactive patterns; efficiency in core user flows like login; and immediate, clear feedback for user actions. Crucially, the design must embody the product belief that it 'must feel obvious without documentation', making the application inherently understandable. This foundation will serve the needs of developers by providing a stable and documented framework for building features rapidly, and end-users by offering a modern, intuitive, and consistent application experience, starting with a seamless login and a clear, functional dashboard.
