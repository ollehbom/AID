This foundational feature establishes the core user interface for our application, addressing the critical need for a modern, consistent, and extensible UI platform. Its primary purpose is to enable rapid prototyping and validation of future user-centric features, overcoming the current inability to effectively test new ideas due to a lack of a cohesive front-end infrastructure. It directly supports our foundational belief that a robust UI platform is essential for agile product development and user belief validation. The application, starting with the login and dashboard, should feel modern, professional, and reliable. Users, particularly our technically competent founders, should perceive it as intuitive, fast, and straightforward, requiring no prior explanation or documentation to navigate. The experience should be consistent across all initial touchpoints, instilling confidence in the platform's stability and future capabilities. The login process should feel secure and frictionless, while the dashboard should convey clarity and organization, providing an immediate sense of purpose and readiness for action. Principles guiding the interaction include: Simplicity & Directness (users value speed, product must feel obvious); Consistency (uniform visual language via shadcn/ui); Efficiency (optimized for speed); Clarity over Complexity (unambiguous UI, natural guidance); and Security & Trust (robust Google OAuth). This design addresses the internal need for a stable platform for rapid iteration, and for the end-user, it provides secure, easy access, an organized overview, and a professional-looking tool.
