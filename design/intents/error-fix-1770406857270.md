## Design Intent: Foundational UI/UX (Google Login & Basic Dashboard)

### Why does this feature exist?
This feature exists to establish the foundational user interface and experience for the product. It's a critical first step to transition from product conceptualization to a tangible, interactive application. By implementing a modern React application with `shadcn/ui`, a functional Google login, and a basic dashboard, we aim to provide a robust and consistent framework for all future UI development. This addresses the current lack of a standardized UI foundation, which leads to inconsistent user experiences and slower development cycles.

### How should it feel to users?
The initial interaction should feel **modern, professional, and intuitively simple**. For technical users, the experience should be **efficient and frictionless**, allowing them to quickly access the application without unnecessary cognitive load. The design should convey a sense of reliability and a well-thought-out system from the very first interaction.

### What principles guide the interaction?
1.  **Obviousness**: Aligned with the core belief "The product must feel obvious without documentation," the login and dashboard should be immediately understandable without requiring any guidance or complex instructions. Actions should be self-evident.
2.  **Speed over Configurability**: Reflecting the core belief "Users value speed over configurability," the login process is streamlined via Google OAuth, prioritizing quick access over extensive setup options. The dashboard should offer quick insights or access points.
3.  **Consistency**: Leveraging `shadcn/ui` ensures a consistent visual language, component behavior, and overall aesthetic from the outset. This consistency builds trust and reduces learning curves.
4.  **Clarity**: User actions and system feedback (e.g., login success/failure) must be clear, concise, and unambiguous. Visual hierarchy will guide the user's attention effectively.
5.  **Efficiency**: Minimize steps and cognitive effort required to log in and navigate to the core application area.

### What user needs does it address?
-   **Secure and Easy Access**: Provides a straightforward and recognized method for authentication (Google login).
-   **Consistent User Experience**: Establishes a unified design language that technical users can quickly learn and expect across the application.
-   **Foundation for Productivity**: Offers a basic dashboard as a starting point, signaling that the application is ready for interaction and future feature integration.
-   **Reduced Friction**: Eliminates the pain point of inconsistent or ad-hoc UI, allowing users to focus on product value rather than navigating a confusing interface.
