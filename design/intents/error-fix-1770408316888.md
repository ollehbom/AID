# Design Intent: Foundational Frontend Architecture (error-fix-1770408316888)This design intent outlines the foundational frontend architecture, encompassing a React application, Shadcn UI integration, Google login, and a basic dashboard.## 1. Why does this feature exist?This foundational feature exists to establish a robust, modern, and consistent frontend framework for the entire product. It is the critical initial step to enable all subsequent feature development, addressing the current absence of a standardized UI/UX. By setting up a reliable and performant base, we aim to accelerate future development cycles and ensure a cohesive user experience from the outset. It directly supports the core product beliefs of providing an obvious and speedy user experience.## 2. How should it feel to users?*   **Obvious and Intuitive:** The primary interactions, particularly the Google login process and the initial dashboard view, must be immediately understandable without requiring any guidance or documentation. Users should instinctively know what to do next.*   **Fast and Responsive:** All interactions, from page loads to button clicks, should feel quick and without perceptible delay. This aligns with the core belief that "Users value speed over configurability."*   **Clean and Professional:** A consistent visual language, driven by the Shadcn UI components, should convey a sense of reliability, polish, and thoughtful design.

Ambiguity is to be strictly avoided.*   **Consistency:** Strict adherence to the established design system (Shadcn UI) for all visual and interactive patterns. This builds user familiarity, reduces cognitive load, and reinforces the product's professionalism.*   **Efficiency:** Critical user flows, such as the login and initial navigation, should be streamlined to minimize user effort and time. Avoid unnecessary steps or information.*   **Immediate Feedback:** Users should receive clear and timely feedback for their actions, whether it's a successful login, a loading state, or an error message.## 4. What user needs does it address?*   **Secure and Easy Access:** The Google login provides a familiar, secure, and low-friction entry point into the application, catering to users who prefer quick authentication methods.*   **A Clear Starting Point:** The basic dashboard offers an initial, comprehensible view of the application's core functionality or status, preventing a
