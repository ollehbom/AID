### Why this feature exists:This foundational feature serves as the bedrock for all subsequent user-facing development. Its primary purpose is to establish a modern, scalable, and consistent frontend architecture, leveraging React and shadcn/ui. This investment aims to accelerate future feature development by providing a robust and reusable component library, thereby ensuring a consistent and positive initial user experience. It directly addresses the need to move beyond ad-hoc UI development and validates the emerging belief that "A robust design system accelerates development and enhances initial user impression."### How it should feel to users:The initial interaction, particularly the login screen and basic dashboard, should evoke feelings of security, professionalism, and ease of use.- Login: Users should feel confident in the security of their data, with a straightforward, minimal-friction authentication process. It should feel quick and trustworthy.- Dashboard: Upon successful login, the dashboard should feel clean, organized, intuitive, and performant. It should immediately convey a sense of purpose and provide a clear overview, making the user feel in control and well-oriented within the application.- Overall: The experience should be modern, polished, and reliable, reinforcing the core belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation."### Principles guiding interaction:1. Clarity & Obviousness: Every UI element and interaction should be unambiguous. Users, especially new ones, must be able to predict what happens next without confusion. The design should guide them implicitly.2. Consistency: A uniform application of design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) and interaction patterns will ensure a cohesive experience. This is critical for building trust and reducing cognitive load.3. Efficiency: Interactions, particularly authentication, should be swift and direct, respecting the user's time. The primary user, being technically competent, values speed.4. Simplicity: Focus on essential information and functionality, avoiding unnecessary clutter. The interface should be lean and purposeful.5. Feedback: Provide clear, immediate visual feedback for user actions and system states (e.g., loading, success, error) to keep users informed and confident.### User needs it addresses:- Secure Access: Users need a reliable and trusted method to log into the application (Google authentication).- Initial Orientation: Upon entry, users need to quickly grasp the application's structure and their current position/options, fostering a sense of familiarity.- Trust & Professionalism: Users need to perceive the application as stable, well-built, and professional, which a consistent and polished UI delivers.- Effortless Interaction: Users require an interface that is easy to navigate and understand without external guidance, aligning with the "obvious without documentation" belief.
