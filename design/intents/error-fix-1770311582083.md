## Design Intent for Feature: Foundational UI (error-fix-1770311582083)

**Why this feature exists:**
This feature establishes the core user interface and technical foundation for the product. Its primary purpose is to move beyond conceptualization to a tangible, interactive application. It enables initial user access via Google login and provides a basic dashboard, serving as a critical stepping stone for all future feature development. This foundational build directly addresses the current absence of a functional application, which is a major pain point preventing any user interaction or further progress. It also serves to validate the hypothesis that a modern React application with Shadcn UI provides a robust and extensible framework for efficient development and a positive initial user experience.

**How it should feel to users:**
The user experience should feel **secure, straightforward, and familiar** during the Google login process, leveraging existing user trust in Google's authentication. Upon entering the dashboard, users should perceive a **clean, organized, modern, and highly responsive** environment. The overall impression should be one of **reliability, trustworthiness, and intuitive design**, signifying a high-quality, professional application even in its foundational state. The UI should be performant and react quickly to interactions.

**What principles guide the interaction:**
1.  **Clarity & Obviousness:** Every interaction and UI element, particularly the login flow and dashboard navigation, must be immediately understandable without requiring documentation or prior experience. This aligns with the core belief: "The product must feel obvious without documentation."
2.  **Simplicity & Efficiency:** Minimize cognitive load. The login process should be swift, and the dashboard layout should be uncluttered, allowing users to quickly grasp its purpose and navigate.
3.  **Consistency:** Adherence to the Shadcn UI design system ensures a unified visual language and predictable interaction patterns across the application, fostering familiarity and reducing learning curves.
4.  **Trustworthiness:** Especially critical for authentication, the design must convey security and legitimacy.
5.  **Responsiveness:** The layout and components should adapt gracefully across various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on different devices.

**What user needs it addresses:**
This feature directly addresses the user's need for **access** to the application through a secure and familiar login method. It provides **orientation** by offering a central dashboard from which they can understand the application's structure and eventually navigate to core functionalities. Fundamentally, it builds **trust** in the product's stability and professional quality, which is essential for user adoption and retention.
