This feature exists to establish the foundational frontend for the product, providing a stable, intuitive, and modern platform for user interaction and future development. It addresses the critical need for a user interface to onboard users, demonstrate core product functionality, and validate foundational product beliefs.

The user experience should feel:
*   **Obvious and Intuitive**: Users, especially technically competent ones, should immediately understand how to log in and navigate the basic dashboard without needing documentation or guidance.
*   **Polished and Modern**: The interface should convey professionalism and reliability through a clean aesthetic, consistent design system (shadcn/ui), and responsive interactions.
*   **Fast and Efficient**: The core login and dashboard access should be quick, minimizing any perceived latency or unnecessary steps, aligning with the belief that "users value speed over configurability."

Interaction principles:
*   **Clarity over Complexity**: Prioritize straightforward actions and clear labeling. Avoid ambiguity in UI elements or calls to action.
*   **Direct Engagement**: Enable users to quickly achieve their initial goal (logging in and seeing the dashboard) with minimal friction.
*   **Consistency**: Adhere to the established design system for all UI components and interactions to build familiarity and trust.

This design addresses the user need to:
*   Access the product's features through a secure and familiar authentication method (Google login).
*   Gain immediate visibility into the product's capabilities via a basic, yet functional, dashboard.
*   Experience a consistent and high-quality user interface that supports future learning and engagement.
