Why does this feature exist?
This foundational feature establishes the core user-facing application, providing a modern, consistent, and intuitive entry point for users. It directly addresses the critical need for a frontend application to enable all subsequent product development and user interaction. Without this, no other product beliefs can be tested or features delivered.

How should it feel to users?
Users should experience a sense of **effortless professionalism**. The application should feel **obvious** and **predictable**, requiring no documentation or prior explanation to navigate the login process and understand the basic dashboard. It should convey **reliability** and **speed**, with quick loading times and responsive interactions, reinforcing the belief that "Users value speed over configurability." The visual aesthetic, driven by `shadcn/ui`, should feel **modern, clean, and consistent**, instilling confidence in the product's quality and alignment with the user's technical competence.

What principles guide the interaction?
1. **Obviousness**: Every interaction, from logging in to viewing the dashboard, must be self-explanatory. Ambiguity is friction.
2. **Consistency**: Leverage `shadcn/ui` to ensure a unified visual language and interaction patterns across all elements.
3. **Efficiency**: Streamline core flows (e.g., login) to minimize steps and cognitive load.
4. **Clarity**: Information presented on the dashboard should be direct and easy to interpret, catering to technically competent users who appreciate precision.
5. **Feedback**: Provide clear and immediate feedback for all user actions (e.g., successful login, loading states, error messages) to maintain a sense of control and predictability.

What user needs does it address?
This feature addresses the user's fundamental need for a **secure and straightforward way to access the application** (via Google login). It provides a **clear and consistent starting point** (the basic dashboard) where they can begin to engage with the product's core functionality. Ultimately, it lays the groundwork for a product that aligns with their expectation of a **technically sound, visually appealing, and intuitive tool** that respects their time and intelligence.
