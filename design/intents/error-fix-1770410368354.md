### 1. Why this feature exists:This feature establishes the core foundation of our application, providing the initial user entry point and setting the stage for all future development. Its primary purpose is to deliver a robust, modern, and intuitive platform from day one. By integrating a modern design system (Shadcn UI), secure Google authentication, and a basic dashboard, we aim to validate our core beliefs about user experience and provide a frictionless onboarding for technically competent users. This is not about addressing an existing pain point but proactively building a strong architectural and experiential base.### 2. How it should feel to users:The user experience should feel **obvious, intuitive, and effortlessly modern**. Upon first interaction, users should immediately grasp how to log in using their Google account and seamlessly transition to a functional dashboard. The application should convey a sense of **speed, responsiveness, and professional polish**, reflecting the underlying design system. There should be no moments of confusion, delay, or uncertainty; the journey from landing page to dashboard access must be **frictionless and predictable**. Users should feel confident and secure in their interaction with the platform.### 3. What principles guide the interaction:-   **Clarity & Predictability**: Every interactive element, from the login button to dashboard navigation, must clearly communicate its purpose and anticipated outcome. Users should always be able to predict what happens next.-   **Simplicity & Directness**: Minimize cognitive load. The path to successful login and dashboard access should be the shortest and most direct possible, free from unnecessary steps or complex configurations.-   **Consistency & Modernity**: Adherence to the Shadcn UI design system ensures a unified, aesthetically pleasing, and up-to-date look and feel across all components.-   **Efficiency & Speed**: Interactions should be swift, and load times minimal, reinforcing our belief that "Users value speed over configurability."-   **Trust & Security**: Leveraging Google authentication provides a familiar and trusted method for account access, enhancing user confidence in the platform's security.### 4. What user needs does it address:This foundational feature directly addresses the user's fundamental need for **access** to the application. It provides a secure and straightforward mechanism for **authentication**, ensuring only authorized users can enter. Once authenticated, it fulfills the need for **orientation** by presenting a clear, albeit basic, dashboard that serves as their initial home within the application, offering a sense of place and control. Ultimately, it caters to the need for an **efficient and intuitive start**, enabling technical users to quickly engage with the platform without the need for external guidance or documentation.
