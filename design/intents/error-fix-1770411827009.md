### Why this feature exists:This foundational feature establishes the very first interactive touchpoint for our product. Its primary purpose is to lay a robust, modern, and consistent user interface groundwork using React and `shadcn/ui`. By integrating Google authentication and a basic dashboard, it addresses the critical need to move beyond a non-interactive state, enabling initial user engagement and serving as the platform for validating our core product beliefs and future feature development. It's the essential first step to providing a tangible product experience.### How it should feel to users:The application should feel **modern, intuitive, and immediate**. For our technically competent users, it should convey a sense of **professionalism and reliability**, instilling confidence from the first interaction. The experience should be **low-friction and obvious**, allowing users to quickly understand how to navigate and interact without needing explicit guidance or documentation. Authentication should be seamless and secure, and the overall performance should be fast and responsive, reinforcing the belief that "Users value speed over configurability."### What principles guide the interaction:1.  **Obviousness & Discoverability**: In alignment with "The product must feel obvious without documentation," the UI must be inherently intuitive. Navigation, primary actions, and information presentation on the dashboard should be self-explanatory, requiring minimal cognitive load.2.  **Speed & Efficiency**: Every interaction, from login to loading the dashboard, should be designed for speed. This means optimizing for quick load times, responsive UI elements, and direct paths to core functionalities, reflecting "Users value speed over configurability."3.  **Consistency & Predictability**: Leveraging `shadcn/ui` ensures a consistent visual language and interaction patterns across the application. This predictability reduces learning curves and builds user trust.4.  **Security & Trust**: Google authentication provides a familiar, secure, and trusted method for access, reinforcing the reliability of the platform.5.  **Foundation for Growth**: The design should be extensible, allowing for the seamless integration of future features without compromising the established design system or user experience.### What user needs it addresses:This feature addresses the fundamental need for an interactive product interface. Specifically, it provides:*   **Secure Access**: A straightforward and trusted method to log in using Google authentication.*   **Initial Orientation**: A clear and functional dashboard that serves as the user's home base within the application, even if initially populated with mock content.*   **Consistent Experience**: A predictable and aesthetically pleasing interface that aligns with modern web application standards.*   **Foundation for Future Value**: While basic, it enables users to perceive the product as a legitimate, developing platform, ready for the features that will address their deeper technical needs.
