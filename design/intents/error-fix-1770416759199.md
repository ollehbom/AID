### Why this feature exists:This foundational build-out establishes the core technical and user experience framework for our new React application. It integrates essential components like Shadcn UI for a modern aesthetic, Google login for streamlined access, and a basic dashboard to serve as the initial user landing page. The primary purpose is to create a robust, scalable, and visually consistent platform that enables rapid future feature development and user adoption. It directly addresses the need to move from conceptual beliefs to a tangible, interactive product, laying the groundwork for validating further product hypotheses.### How it should feel to users:The user experience should feel **obvious, fast, and modern**. Users, primarily technically competent, should navigate the initial login and dashboard without any hesitation or need for documentation. The interface should convey a sense of professionalism and reliability, instilling trust from the first interaction. Interactions should be highly responsive, emphasizing the product belief that "users value speed over configurability." The overall sensation should be one of effortless efficiency and intuitive control, making the user feel immediately productive and at home within the application.### Principles guiding the interaction:1.  **Obviousness**: Every interactive element and flow must be immediately understandable. No hidden features or obscure metaphors. The path from login to dashboard should be a straight, clear line.2.  **Efficiency & Speed**: Minimize cognitive load and interaction steps. Leverage Google login for quick authentication. Ensure UI elements load swiftly and respond instantly to user input.3.  **Consistency**: Adhere strictly to the established design system (Shadcn UI) to create a unified and predictable visual language across all initial screens and components.4.  **Clarity & Feedback**: Provide clear visual feedback for all actions (e.g., loading states during login, button presses). Use concise and unambiguous language.5.  **Security & Trust**: Implement Google login in a manner that clearly communicates security and protects user data, fostering confidence in the platform.### User needs it addresses:-   **Effortless Access**: Users need a simple, secure, and familiar method to authenticate and gain access to the application, addressed by Google login.-   **Clear Orientation**: Upon successful login, users need to be immediately presented with a coherent and understandable environment (the dashboard) where they can orient themselves and understand the application's purpose.-   **Trust & Professionalism**: Users need to perceive the application as a reliable, well-built, and professional tool, which is addressed by a modern UI, consistent design, and smooth performance.-   **Foundational Stability**: For future feature adoption, users need a stable and predictable base that performs reliably.
