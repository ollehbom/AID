### Why this feature exists?
This foundational feature exists to establish a robust and modern technical platform for our product. It translates the product hypothesis: "having a foundational React application with a modern design system, Google login, and a basic dashboard will result in faster validation of core product value propositions" into a tangible, deployable application. By providing a secure login mechanism and a clear entry point, it unblocks the ability to conduct real user interaction and gather feedback on subsequent features, addressing the current pain point of lacking a tangible product. It serves as the essential groundwork upon which all future 'Open / Unproven' beliefs can be tested and validated.

### How should it feel to users?
Users should experience a sense of security, professionalism, and ease. The login process, powered by Google OAuth, should feel familiar, trustworthy, and remarkably efficient, minimizing cognitive load and friction. Upon successful authentication, the dashboard should present itself as a clean, intuitive, and welcoming hub, signaling stability and readiness for further interaction. The overall aesthetic, driven by shadcn/ui and an initial design system, should convey modernity and a thoughtful, polished experience, instilling confidence in the application's stability and future potential, even in this early stage.

### What principles guide the interaction?
1.  **Obviousness:** Every interaction, from clicking "Login with Google" to navigating the dashboard, should be immediately understandable without requiring prior explanation or documentation. The path forward should be clear and predictable.
2.  **Efficiency:** Minimize steps and decision points. Authentication should be swift and seamless, and access to core functionality (even mock in this phase) should be direct, respecting the user's time.
3.  **Consistency:** Leverage shadcn/ui and a defined initial design system to ensure a unified visual language and predictable behavior across all foundational components, fostering a cohesive user experience.
4.  **Trust:** Especially for authentication, the UI must clearly communicate security and transparency, building user confidence in handling their access and personal information.
5.  **Scalability:** While basic, the design should lay a flexible groundwork that can easily accommodate future feature additions and evolving user needs without requiring architectural overhauls, ensuring long-term adaptability.

### What user needs does it address?
This feature directly addresses the user's fundamental need for a secure, hassle-free way to access the application. It provides a clear, organized starting point (the dashboard) for their engagement with the product, removing the ambiguity of where to begin. Fundamentally, it fulfills the need for a reliable and aesthetically pleasing digital environment where they can begin to explore and derive value, setting the stage for validating our 'Open / Unproven' beliefs regarding core features and onboarding. For the founder, it addresses the need for a tangible platform to accelerate product validation.
