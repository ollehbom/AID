The intent behind this foundational frontend build is to establish a robust, modern, and intuitive application experience that serves as the bedrock for all future product development and user interaction. It addresses the critical need for a functional application where users can securely authenticate and begin to interact with core product concepts. For users, the experience should feel obvious, fast, and reliable. Interactions should be immediately understandable without requiring documentation or prior experience. The visual design, driven by shadcn/ui, should convey professionalism and modernity, instilling confidence in the product's stability and future potential. Guiding principles for interaction include: 1. Clarity over Complexity: Every element and flow must be self-explanatory, allowing technically competent users to intuitively predict outcomes. 2. Efficiency and Speed: Minimize steps and wait times, prioritizing direct access to functionality. Users value speed over configurability, so the design should be streamlined. 3. Consistency and Familiarity: Leverage established design patterns and shadcn/ui components to create a cohesive and predictable interface. 4. Trustworthiness: Secure authentication (Google Login) and a stable, responsive UI should communicate reliability. This design aims to provide a frictionless entry point, enabling users to log in effortlessly and access a basic dashboard, thereby fulfilling the foundational need for a secure and intuitive digital workspace from which further product exploration can occur. It directly supports the belief that 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' by setting a high standard for intuitive interaction from day one.
