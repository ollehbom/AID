## Design Intent for Core UI Foundation (feature-2)

### Why this feature exists?
This feature establishes the fundamental user interface for the application, serving as the essential groundwork for all future user-facing development. Its primary purpose is to enable rapid iteration and validation of core user workflows, directly addressing the current inability to test features or gather user feedback due to the absence of a functional application. By providing a stable and modern UI foundation, we can begin to build and test our product beliefs effectively.

### How should it feel to users?
The user experience should feel **obvious, fast, and modern**. Users, particularly technical founders, should find the login process and initial dashboard navigation intuitive and self-explanatory, requiring no documentation or guidance. The interaction should be swift, reflecting our belief that 'Users value speed over configurability'. The visual design, leveraging Shadcn UI, should convey a clean, professional, and trustworthy aesthetic, instilling confidence in the application's stability and future potential.

### What principles guide the interaction?
1.  **Obviousness over Explanation**: Interactions must be inherently understandable. A new user should be able to predict what happens next without hesitation, aligning with the core belief that 'The product must feel obvious without documentation'.
2.  **Efficiency and Speed**: Minimize cognitive load and interaction steps. The login flow and initial dashboard presentation should be streamlined to be as quick and frictionless as possible.
3.  **Consistency**: Adhere strictly to Shadcn UI design principles and components. This ensures a predictable and cohesive user experience from the very first interaction, making the UI feel familiar and robust.
4.  **Clarity and Directness**: Use clear, concise language and direct calls to action. Ambiguity in labels, buttons, or feedback should be avoided.
5.  **Secure and Trustworthy**: The Google login integration should feel seamless and secure, assuring users of their data privacy and the application's reliability.

### What user needs does it address?
This feature primarily addresses the user's need for **secure access** to the application and a **clear starting point** for interaction. For the technical founder, it fulfills the critical need for a **functional platform** to test hypotheses, gather feedback, and iterate on future features. It also lays the foundation for validating whether the application can truly feel intuitive and efficient without explicit guidance, a core belief we aim to prove.
