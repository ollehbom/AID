  "design_intent": "The intent for the foundational React application (error-fix-1770343952534) is to establish a clear, efficient, and intuitive initial user experience. This involves a streamlined Google login process to minimize user friction and a well-structured, extensible dashboard that immediately communicates the application's purpose and readiness for future features. The design prioritizes a modern aesthetic using `shadcn/ui` to align with the product belief that 'Users value speed over configurability' by offering a consistent and quick-to-understand interface. Furthermore, the design aims to be self-explanatory, supporting the belief that 'The product must feel obvious without documentation'.",
  "design_spec": "## 1. OverviewThis document details the design specifications for the foundational React application, incorporating `shadcn/ui` for a consistent design system, Google login for authentication, and a basic dashboard with mock content.## 2. User Flows### 2.1. Authentication Flow (Google Login)#### States:*   **Initial State:** User lands on a dedicated 'Sign In' screen.*   **Interaction:** User clicks 'Sign in with Google' button.*   **Loading State:** A spinner or subtle loading indicator may appear during the Google OAuth process.*   **Success State:** Upon successful authentication, the user is automatically redirected to the Dashboard screen.*   **Error State:** If Google login fails (e.g., network error, user cancels, authentication issue), a non-blocking error message (e.g., a toast notification) should appear, allowing the user to retry.#### Copy:*   **App Title:** 'My Awesome App'*   **Subtitle:** 'Sign in to continue'*   **Button Label:** 'Sign in with Google'*   **Error Message (example):** 'Google sign-in failed. Please try again.'### 2.2. Dashboard Flow#### States:*   **Initial State:** Displays immediately after successful login.*   **Interaction:** Passive viewing of mock content.*   **Error State:** Not applicable for initial dashboard load, assuming data fetching would be added in subsequent features.#### Copy:*   **Header:** 'Dashboard'*   **Welcome Message:** 'Welcome, [User Name]!'*   **Content Card Titles (examples):** 'Mock Data Section', 'Another Section'*   **Content Card Body (examples):** 'This is placeholder content for your dashboard.', 'More mock information here.'## 3. UI Elements & Components*   **App Title:** Large, prominent text (e.g., `h1` equivalent).*   **Subtitle/Prompts:** Standard body text.*   **Buttons:** Standard `shadcn/ui` primary button for 'Sign in with Google'.*   **Headers:** `shadcn/ui` Typography for screen titles.*   **Content Cards:** `shadcn/ui` Card component, containing a title and body text. At least two distinct cards should be present on the dashboard to demonstrate layout and content areas.*   **Layout:** Basic vertical stack for login screen. Dashboard to feature a header, welcome message, and vertically stacked content cards, demonstrating responsive layout capabilities of `shadcn/ui` (e.g., using flexbox/grid for future expansion).## 4. Accessibility & Responsiveness*   All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable and have appropriate ARIA labels.*   The design must be responsive, ensuring usability on mobile (375px width target) and larger screens.",

  "summary": "The design for the 'Establish Core React Application' feature focuses on creating a seamless initial user experience. This includes a clear Google login flow and a foundational dashboard with mock content, both leveraging `shadcn/ui` for a modern and consistent aesthetic. The design intent emphasizes efficiency and intuitiveness, directly supporting core product beliefs around user speed and self-explanatory interfaces. The validation confirms that the proposed design ensures predictability for new users, timely information delivery, and a strong alignment between the UI and the product's overarching goals, preparing the ground for subsequent feature development."
