  "design_intent": "To provide a secure, intuitive, and low-friction entry point to the application, setting the foundation for rapid feature iteration while adhering to the core belief that the product must feel obvious. Specifically, for the login experience, the intent is to enable quick and familiar authentication via Google for technically competent users.",
  "design_spec": "This foundational design defines the initial user experience for application access and authentication. The primary flow involves presenting a login screen with a clear 'Sign in with Google' option. Upon user interaction, the system will initiate the Google authentication process. Successful authentication will seamlessly redirect the user to the core application dashboard. The design prioritizes a straightforward, single-action entry point, minimizing cognitive load and leveraging a familiar authentication method.",
