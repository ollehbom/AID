  "design_intent": "The intent behind this foundational frontend build is to establish a robust, modern, and intuitive application experience that serves as the bedrock for all future product development and user interaction. It aims to validate the chosen tech stack (React, shadcn/ui, Google Auth) for rapid UI development, ensure a consistent and accessible design system, and provide a functional base for testing core product beliefs regarding user workflows and ease of use. The core belief 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' is central to this design, emphasizing clarity in authentication and dashboard presentation, and providing clear feedback for any errors encountered.",
  "design_spec": "# Design Specification: Foundational Frontend Application\n\n**Feature ID**: foundational-frontend-build\n\n## 1. Complete User Flow\n\nThis specification outlines the initial user journey for the foundational frontend application, covering application load, user authentication via Google, and access to a basic dashboard.\n\n*   **Application Load**: User navigates to the application URL. A loading spinner (shadcn/ui `Spinner`) is displayed while the application initializes.\n*   **Authentication**:\n    *   **Initial State**: If not authenticated, the user is presented with a login screen.\n    *   **Login Prompt**: A prominent 'Login with Google' button (shadcn/ui `Button`) is displayed. Accompanying text explains the purpose of login (e.g., 'Access your dashboard').\n    *   **Google Auth Flow**: Clicking the button redirects to Google's authentication page.\n    *   **Post-Login**: Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the application.\n*   **Dashboard**:\n    *   **Content**: Displays mock content to simulate a functional dashboard. This includes a welcome message (e.g., 'Welcome, [User Name]!'), a section for 'Recent Activity' with placeholder items (shadcn/ui `Card` or `Table`), and a 'Quick Links' section with dummy buttons/links.\n    *   **Navigation**: A simple header with the application logo/name and a 'Logout' button (shadcn/ui `Button`).\n    *   **Empty States**: Considerations for potential empty states if mock content isn't immediately available (e.g., 'No activity yet.').\n*   **Error Handling**:\n    *   **Authentication Errors**: If Google login fails, a clear, concise error message is displayed on the login screen (e.g., 'Login failed. Please try again.').\n    *   **Generic Application Errors**: For unforeseen issues, a simple error page (as wireframed for `error-fix-1770399830153`) with an option to return home.\n*   **Design System Integration**: All UI elements (buttons, cards, text, spinners, dialogs for errors) must adhere to `shadcn/ui` components for consistency and modern aesthetics.\n*   **Responsiveness**: The design should be responsive for mobile (375px width) and desktop views, ensuring core functionality and readability across devices.",

  "validation_checklist": "*   Can a new user predict what happens next when logging in or navigating the dashboard?\n*   Is anything explained too late, especially regarding the purpose of login or dashboard content?\n*   Does the UI for login and dashboard match the intent of being robust, modern, and intuitive, using `shadcn/ui` consistently?\n*   Is the Google login flow clear and without unnecessary friction?\n*   Does the dashboard clearly display mock content, indicating successful application load and user authentication?\n*   Are error messages clear, concise, and actionable, especially for authentication failures and generic application errors?\n*   Does the initial application load feel performant enough (no excessive loading times)?",
  "summary": "The design for the foundational frontend application establishes a modern, intuitive user experience leveraging `shadcn/ui` and Google authentication. It defines a clear user flow from app load to authenticated dashboard access, ensuring consistency and adherence to the product belief of being 'obvious without documentation'. The design incorporates basic error handling, including a wireframe for a generic error screen, and sets the stage for rapid iteration."
