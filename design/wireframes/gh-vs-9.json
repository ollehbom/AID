  "design_intent": "The foundational React application, integrating shadcn/ui, Google Login, and a basic dashboard (feature gh-vs-9), exists to establish a robust and intuitive entry point for our technical users. Its primary intent is to provide a clean, modern, and immediately understandable user experience that aligns with our belief that the product must feel obvious without documentation. By leveraging shadcn/ui and a streamlined Google Login, we aim to minimize cognitive load and accelerate user engagement, supporting the belief that users value speed over configurability. This initial design establishes a consistent visual language and interaction patterns for all subsequent features.",
  "design_spec": "This design spec builds upon the detailed flow, states, copy, and error handling defined in the previously generated spec for feature `gh-vs-9`. It outlines two primary states: the unauthenticated 'Sign In' page, featuring a prominent 'Sign in with Google' button, and the authenticated 'Dashboard' page, displaying a welcome message and mock content. The interaction flow is linear: unauthenticated users are directed to sign in, and upon successful authentication, they are immediately navigated to the dashboard. All UI elements adhere to `shadcn/ui` principles for consistency and modern aesthetics.",

  "validation_checklist": "1.  **Can a new user predict what happens next?**\n    *   **Sign-In Screen**: The clear 'Sign in with Google' button explicitly indicates the next action and expected outcome (authentication). The presence of a single, prominent action minimizes ambiguity.\n    *   **Post-Sign-In**: Landing directly on a 'Dashboard' page with a welcome message and relevant content is a highly predictable and common pattern for authenticated users, aligning with established mental models.\n2.  **Is anything explained too late?**\n    *   The purpose of the initial screen (to sign in) is immediately clear from the header. The method of entry (Google) is presented upfront. Post-login, the dashboard's purpose is implied by its name and the presence of 'Your Projects' or similar content. No critical information required for user progression or understanding appears to be delayed.\n3.  **Does the UI match the intent?**\n    *   **Intent**: To provide an obvious, fast, intuitive, modern, and consistent user experience, especially for technical users, aligning with beliefs like 'product must feel obvious without documentation' and 'users value speed over configurability'.\n    *   **UI Match**: The minimalistic Sign-In screen with a single, clear action button directly supports 'speed' and 'obvious'. The implied `shadcn/ui` integration (from the spec) ensures 'modern' and 'consistent' aesthetics. Direct navigation to a dashboard post-login enhances 'speed' and provides an 'intuitive' experience. The absence of complex configurations on these initial screens explicitly aligns with the belief that 'users value speed over configurability'. The overall simple, direct flow from sign-in to dashboard with clear actions and minimal distractions aligns strongly with the stated design intent and product beliefs.",
  "summary": "The design for feature `gh-vs-9` (Core Application Foundation) is complete. It includes a clear design intent focused on an obvious, fast, and intuitive experience for technical users, leveraging `shadcn/ui` for modern aesthetics. The design spec outlines the unauthenticated sign-in flow via Google and the authenticated dashboard state. The wireframe JSON provides a structural representation of these two key screens, ensuring a direct translation for the development agent. Validation confirms that the design promotes predictability for new users, avoids delayed explanations, and aligns strongly with the product's core beliefs of being obvious without documentation and valuing speed over configurability. This stage is ready for handoff to the Dev Agent."
