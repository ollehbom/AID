  "validation_checklist": "- [ ] **Login Predictability:** Can a new user easily predict that clicking \"Sign in with Google\" will initiate a Google authentication flow and then lead to the dashboard?- [ ] **Timeliness of Explanation:** Is the purpose of the login page clear immediately upon arrival? Is any necessary information (e.g., \"Sign in to continue\") presented upfront?- [ ] **UI-Intent Match (Login):** Does the \"Sign in with Google\" button clearly convey its action? Does the overall simplicity of the login page align with the intent of \"speed over configurability\" and \"obvious without documentation\"?- [ ] **UI-Intent Match (Dashboard):** Does the basic dashboard clearly indicate a successful login and a starting point for interaction, aligning with the intent of providing a functional base?- [ ] **Shadcn Adherence:** Do the wireframe elements (e.g., button, card styling) align with general Shadcn UI principles for a clean, modern aesthetic?",
  "summary": "The design establishes a clear and minimal UI foundation, comprising a Google login screen and a basic dashboard. The login flow is designed for immediate clarity and low friction, directly supporting the product belief that users value speed and the product should feel obvious. The dashboard provides a straightforward entry point post-authentication. Validation will focus on user predictability, timely information delivery, and a strong match between the UI's simplicity and the foundational product intent."
