  "design_intent": "The intent for the Foundational Error Handling System is to provide users with clear, consistent, and actionable feedback when unexpected issues occur. It aims to reduce user frustration by explaining what went wrong, suggesting next steps, and maintaining a predictable experience even in error states. This system is crucial for a robust and user-friendly foundational application.",
  "design_spec": "# Design Specification: Foundational Error Handling System (error-fix-1770408751512) Overview This specification outlines the design for a consistent, clear, and actionable error handling system within the new React application. Its primary goal is to guide users through unexpected issues during their interaction with the application, ensuring they understand the problem and know how to proceed. It will cover various error types, including network errors, server errors, and client-side validation failures. Errors will be presented in a non-intrusive yet noticeable manner, typically using toast notifications for transient issues and full-screen overlays or dedicated error pages for critical, unrecoverable errors. Each error message will include a concise description of the problem, a suggested action (e.g., 'Try again', 'Contact support', 'Check your internet connection'), and potentially a unique error code for debugging. Consistency in UI elements, typography, and tone will be maintained across all error messages, aligning with the established Shadcn UI design system.",

  "validation_checklist": "1. Is the error message clear and easy to understand for a new user, explicitly stating what went wrong?2. Is the error explained immediately when it occurs, preventing user confusion due to delayed feedback?3. Does the error message provide clear, actionable steps for the user to resolve the issue or proceed (e.g., 'Try again', 'Contact support')?4. Are error messages and their presentation consistent across different parts of the application, aligning with the UI intent?5. For minor, non-critical errors, is the feedback non-blocking yet sufficiently noticeable to the user?6. Does the UI visually communicate the severity of the error (e.g., critical error vs. warning) appropriately?",
  "summary": "The design for the Foundational Error Handling System focuses on providing a consistent, clear, and actionable user experience during unexpected issues. By standardizing error messages, providing immediate feedback with clear next steps, and leveraging Shadcn UI for consistent presentation, the system aims to minimize user frustration and maintain a predictable interaction flow across the application. The wireframe illustrates a generic critical error state with options to retry or seek support, embodying the core principles of clarity and actionability. This system is designed to meet the product belief of providing an obvious experience without extensive documentation, even in error scenarios."
