  "design_intent": "The core intent for the initial application build is to establish a modern, intuitive, and highly functional user interface that provides a strong first impression. The design should clearly communicate the product's value proposition from the outset, enabling users to understand and engage with the application without friction or the need for external documentation. It aims to reinforce the belief that 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' and 'Users value speed over configurability' by offering a streamlined Google login process and a clean, informative dashboard. The overall experience should feel reliable, fast, and trustworthy, setting a solid foundation for future feature development.",
  "design_spec": "## Design Specification for Initial Core Application\n\n### 1. User Flow: Google Login & Dashboard Access\n\n**A. Google Login Screen (Initial State)**\n-   **Entry Point**: User navigates to the application URL.\n-   **Elements**: \n    -   Prominent 'Welcome' header.\n    -   Clear subtitle: 'Sign in to your account'.\n    -   Primary Call-to-Action (CTA): 'Sign in with Google' button.\n-   **Interaction**: User clicks 'Sign in with Google'.\n\n**B. Authentication Process (Intermediate State)**\n-   **Transition**: Application initiates Google OAuth flow.\n-   **Feedback**: A brief loading indicator or spinner may be displayed, though ideally, the transition to Google's authentication page is swift.\n-   **Error Handling**: If Google authentication fails (e.g., network error, user cancels), a non-intrusive toast notification will appear at the top of the screen: 'Google sign-in failed. Please try again.' The user remains on the login screen.\n\n**C. Dashboard Screen (Post-Login State)**\n-   **Entry Point**: Successful Google authentication redirects the user to the dashboard.\n-   **Elements**: \n    -   Prominent 'Dashboard' header.\n    -   Personalized welcome message: 'Welcome, [User Name]!' (where [User Name] is retrieved from Google profile).\n    -   A 'Recent Activity' card with placeholder content (e.g., 'You have no new notifications.').\n    -   A secondary button: 'View Profile'.\n-   **Interaction**: The dashboard serves as the primary landing page, providing an overview and access to core functionalities.\n\n### 2. Visual & Interaction Design Principles\n-   **Design System**: Adherence to Shadcn UI components and design guidelines for consistency, accessibility, and a modern aesthetic.\n-   **Responsiveness**: The UI components and layout should adapt gracefully to various screen sizes (mobile-first approach implied by wireframe dimensions).\n-   **Feedback**: Clear visual feedback for interactive elements (e.g., button states: hover, active, disabled).\n\n### 3. Copy & Content\n-   **Login Screen**: \n    -   Header: 'Welcome'\n    -   Subtitle: 'Sign in to your account'\n    -   Button: 'Sign in with Google'\n-   **Dashboard Screen**: \n    -   Header: 'Dashboard'\n    -   Welcome Message: 'Welcome, [User Name]!'\n    -   Recent Activity Card Title: 'Recent Activity'\n    -   Recent Activity Card Content: 'You have no new notifications.'\n    -   Button: 'View Profile'\n\n### 4. Error Handling\n-   **Google Login Failure**: 'Google sign-in failed. Please try again.' (Toast notification, disappears after 3-5 seconds).",

  "validation_checklist": "### Validation Checklist for Initial Core Application Design\n\n**1. Can a new user predict what happens next?**\n-   [ ] Is the 'Sign in with Google' button's purpose immediately clear upon landing on the login screen?\n-   [ ] Does clicking the 'Sign in with Google' button clearly indicate that an external authentication flow will begin?\n-   [ ] Is the transition from a successful login to the dashboard screen intuitive and expected, without surprising redirects or delays?\n-   [ ] Is it clear what the 'Dashboard' screen offers at a glance (e.g., an overview of user-specific information or actions)?\n\n**2. Is anything explained too late?**\n-   [ ] Are all necessary instructions for initial access (i.e., 'Sign in with Google') present on the first screen the user encounters?\n-   [ ] Is the primary method of authentication (Google) immediately obvious, preventing users from searching for other options?\n-   [ ] If a login error occurs, is the feedback immediate, clear, and actionable?\n-   [ ] Does the dashboard immediately convey its purpose or provide a clear starting point for user interaction, rather than requiring exploration?\n\n**3. Does the UI match the intent?**\n-   [ ] Does the visual design, using Shadcn principles, convey a modern, clean, and intuitive aesthetic, aligning with the goal of feeling 'obvious without documentation'?\n-   [ ] Is the Google login process as streamlined and friction-free as possible, supporting the 'Users value speed over configurability' belief?\n-   [ ] Does the dashboard's initial layout feel welcoming and provide a sense of order and clarity, rather than being overwhelming or sparse?\n-   [ ] Are the core UI elements (headers, buttons, cards) consistent in appearance and behavior across the login and dashboard screens?\n-   [ ] Is the copy used on both screens clear, concise, and helpful, avoiding jargon or ambiguity?",
  "summary": "The design for the initial core application focuses on creating a modern, intuitive, and frictionless user experience, starting with a clear Google login and transitioning to a basic dashboard. The design intent emphasizes clarity and speed, aligning with product beliefs 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' and 'Users value speed over configurability'. A detailed design specification outlines the flow, states, copy, and error handling. The wireframe provides a simple representation of the Google Login screen. A comprehensive validation checklist ensures the design meets the stated intent and user experience principles, focusing on predictability, timely information, and UI-to-intent alignment."
