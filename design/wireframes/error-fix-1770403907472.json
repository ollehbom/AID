  "design_intent": "The primary intent for this foundational feature is to establish a clear, modern, and low-friction user entry point into the application, followed by a basic dashboard. This design aims to directly support the product hypothesis of enabling faster validation of core product value propositions by providing a tangible, functional platform. The interaction design prioritizes predictability and simplicity, ensuring that a new user can intuitively understand the login process and navigate to the main dashboard without needing explicit guidance, aligning with the core belief that 'The product must feel obvious without documentation'.",
  "design_spec": "### 1. OverviewThis design specification outlines the initial user experience for the foundational React application, focusing on the login flow and a basic dashboard view.### 2. Login Screen (Initial View)*   **Purpose**: To securely authenticate users via Google OAuth.*   **Elements**:*   **App Title/Logo**: Prominently displayed at the top, e.g., 'Welcome to [App Name]'.*   **Call to Action**: Clear instructional text, e.g., 'Sign in to continue'.*   **Login Button**: A distinct button for 'Sign in with Google'.*   **Flow**: User lands on the Login Screen -> Clicks 'Sign in with Google' -> Redirects to Google's authentication page -> Upon successful authentication, user is redirected to the Dashboard Screen.*   **States**:*   **Initial**: Display of app title, call to action, and Google login button.*   **Loading**: Visual feedback (e.g., spinner) after clicking the login button while awaiting Google's response.*   **Error**: Display of a concise error message if Google authentication fails, with an option to retry.### 3. Dashboard Screen (Post-Login View)*   **Purpose**: To serve as the initial landing page post-authentication, demonstrating successful login and application access.*   **Elements**:*   **Header**: A simple title, e.g., 'Dashboard'.*   **Welcome Message**: Personalized greeting, e.g., 'Welcome back, User!'.*   **Placeholder Content**: A simple card or section containing mock content to indicate functionality (e.g., 'Your recent activity goes here').*   **Flow**: Automatically accessed after successful login.*   **States**:*   **Initial**: Display of header, welcome message, and placeholder content.### 4. Design System Application*   All UI components (text, buttons, frames) will adhere to a consistent design language established by shadcn/ui. This includes typography, color palette, spacing, and component styling to ensure a cohesive and modern aesthetic.",

  "validation_checklist": "1.  **Can a new user predict what happens next?** Yes, the 'Sign in with Google' button clearly indicates the action and expected outcome of initiating a Google OAuth flow.2.  **Is anything explained too late?** No, the purpose of the screen ('Welcome', 'Sign in to continue') and the primary action are immediately clear upon arrival.3.  **Does the UI match the intent?** Yes, the simple UI with a prominent Google login button directly matches the intent of providing Google OAuth for user authentication.4.  **Does the design align with the 'product must feel obvious without documentation' belief?** Yes, the standard and widely recognized Google login pattern requires no external explanation.5.  **Does the design prioritize 'speed over configurability'?** Yes, by offering a direct Google login as the primary (and only initial) authentication method, it streamlines the user's entry into the application.",
  "summary": "The design for the foundational application focuses on a clear, low-friction user entry point through a Google Login screen, leading to a basic dashboard. The wireframe provides a simple, predictable flow, directly supporting the product intent to quickly enable experimentation and validate core value propositions. This design adheres to the principle of making the product feel obvious without documentation, ensuring a smooth and intuitive initial user experience."
