  "design_intent": "The primary intent is to establish a minimal, intuitive, and functional user interface for the product, enabling foundational user interaction and future experimentation. This initial design focuses on a seamless Google login experience and a clear, placeholder dashboard. It embodies the belief that 'the product must feel obvious without documentation' and 'users value speed over configurability' by presenting a straightforward flow with minimal cognitive load, acting as an enabling canvas for subsequent feature development.",
  "design_spec": "## Design Specification: Foundational UI (error-fix-1770405900463)### 1. OverviewThis document details the design specification for the initial user interface, comprising a Google login screen and a basic dashboard. This foundation enables user interaction and future product experimentation, aligning with core product beliefs.### 2. User Flow1.  **User arrives at the application.**2.  **Login Screen (initial state):** Displays a clear 'Sign in with Google' button. No other options are presented to prioritize speed and simplicity.3.  **Google OAuth:** User interacts with Google's standard login flow (handled externally).4.  **Post-Login Redirect:** Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the Dashboard.5.  **Dashboard Screen (post-login state):** Displays a welcoming message and a simple content card with placeholder text, indicating successful access.### 3. UI Elements & States**Login Screen**-   **Title/Header:** 'Welcome to [App Name]' (e.g., 'My Product')-   **Call to Action:** 'Sign in with Google' button.  -   *State:* Default (clickable)-   *Interaction:* On click, initiates Google OAuth flow.**Dashboard Screen**-   **Header:** 'Dashboard'-   **Welcome Message:** 'Welcome to your dashboard!' or similar.-   **Content Area:** A simple card containing placeholder text (e.g., 'This is a placeholder for your content.') and a generic 'Learn More' link. This serves as a visual anchor for future features.### 4. Copy-   Login Screen: 'Welcome to My Product', 'Sign in to continue.', 'Sign in with Google'-   Dashboard Screen: 'Dashboard', 'Welcome to your dashboard!', 'This is a placeholder for your content.', 'Learn More'### 5. Error Handling-   **Login Failure:** If Google OAuth fails (e.g., network error, user cancels), the user is returned to the Login Screen. No specific in-app error message is designed at this foundational stage, relying on standard browser/Google error messages.### 6. Visual Consistency-   Adherence to `shadcn/ui` principles (minimal, clean, functional) will be applied.",

  "validation_checklist": "- **New User Predictability**: Yes, the flow from a single 'Sign in with Google' button to a dashboard is standard and highly predictable for a new user, especially a technically competent one.\n- **Timeliness of Explanation**: All necessary information (sign-in instruction, dashboard content) is presented clearly and immediately. Nothing critical is explained too late. The UI is minimal and self-explanatory.\n- **UI-Intent Match**: \n    - **Intent**: Foundational UI, obvious without documentation, speed over configurability.\n    - **Match**: The design is extremely minimal, focusing on the core login and a basic content display. The single sign-in option prioritizes speed. The lack of complex configurations or hidden features aligns with the 'obvious without documentation' belief. The UI directly supports creating a canvas for future experiments.\n- **Belief Validation (Implicit)**: This design *enables* validation of \"The product must feel obvious without documentation\" and \"Users value speed over configurability\" by providing a baseline UI. The design itself adheres to these principles.",
  "summary": "The design for `error-fix-1770405900463` establishes a foundational, intuitive React application with a Google login and a basic dashboard. The design intent focuses on creating an obvious and fast user experience, aligning with core product beliefs. The wireframes depict a simple two-screen flow, prioritizing minimal friction and clear calls to action. Validation confirms the design's predictability, timely information delivery, and strong match with the stated product intent and beliefs, setting a solid base for future user-facing experiments."
