  "design_intent": "This foundational feature establishes a modern, scalable, and consistent frontend application, primarily aiming to accelerate future feature development and provide a positive initial user experience. The intent is to create a robust and intuitive base that aligns with the belief that a well-defined design system (shadcn/ui) enhances initial user impression and speeds up development, allowing for quick iteration and clear aesthetic direction. The core experience, including login and dashboard, should feel obvious and require no documentation, catering to a technically competent user base who values speed over extensive configurability.",
  "design_spec": "### Design Specification: Feature-1 (Foundational React Application)\n\n#### 1. Overview\nThis specification details the design for the foundational React application, encompassing the login flow with Google authentication, a basic dashboard, and the initial integration of shadcn/ui for a consistent design system.\n\n#### 2. Core Components\n\n**2.1. Login Screen**\n*   **Purpose**: Securely authenticate users via Google.\n*   **States**: \n    *   **Initial**: Displays a prominent \"Sign in with Google\" button.\n    *   **Loading**: Visual indicator (e.g., spinner) while authentication is in progress.\n    *   **Success**: Redirects to the Dashboard.\n    *   **Error**: Displays a clear, concise error message if authentication fails, with an option to retry.\n*   **Copy**: \n    *   Header: \"Welcome!\"\n    *   Call to action: \"Please log in to continue.\"\n    *   Button: \"Sign in with Google\"\n*   **Interaction**: Clicking the button initiates the Google OAuth flow.\n\n**2.2. Dashboard Screen**\n*   **Purpose**: Provide a basic landing page post-authentication, serving as a placeholder for future features.\n*   **States**: \n    *   **Initial**: Displays a welcome message and a basic content card.\n    *   **Loading**: (Future consideration for dynamic content, not in scope for MVP).\n*   **Copy**: \n    *   Header: \"Dashboard\"\n    *   Welcome message: \"Welcome to your dashboard!\"\n    *   Placeholder text: \"This is a placeholder for your content. More features will appear here.\"\n*   **Interaction**: No complex interactions for MVP; primarily a display screen.\n\n**2.3. Design System Integration (shadcn/ui)**\n*   **Purpose**: Establish a consistent visual language and component library.\n*   **Scope**: Initial integration to demonstrate basic components (buttons, text styling, cards) on the Login and Dashboard screens. Define initial color palette, typography (font sizes, weights), and spacing tokens to be used consistently across these screens.\n*   **Components**: \n    *   Buttons (e.g., primary for Google sign-in).\n    *   Text elements (headers, body text).\n    *   Basic layout containers (frames/cards).\n\n#### 3. Flow\n`User arrives at app -> Login Screen (displays 'Sign in with Google' button) -> User clicks 'Sign in with Google' -> Google OAuth flow -> (On successful authentication) -> Redirect to Dashboard Screen (displays welcome and placeholder content).`\n\n#### 4. Error Handling\n*   **Login Failure**: Display a non-intrusive, dismissible alert or message on the Login Screen, indicating authentication failed and prompting retry. (e.g., \"Login failed. Please try again.\")\n\n#### 5. Accessibility\n*   Ensure basic semantic HTML structure for navigation and interactive elements. (Further accessibility enhancements will be addressed in subsequent stages).",
