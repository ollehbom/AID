  "design_intent": "The primary intent is to establish a foundational, intuitive, and efficient initial user experience for technically competent users. This design focuses on creating a seamless entry point via Google login and presenting a clear, functional dashboard. It aims to fulfill the core belief that 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' and address the 'Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance' belief by providing a straightforward and predictable initial interaction.",
  "design_spec": "# Design Specification: Core Application Foundation (Feature ID: error-fix-1770311013114)## 1. OverviewThis specification outlines the design for the initial React application setup, Google login integration, and a basic dashboard display. The goal is to provide a modern, intuitive, and efficient first-time user experience, aligning with the product's core beliefs.## 2. User Flow### 2.1. Initial Application Load1. User accesses the application URL.2. Application checks for an existing authenticated session.### 2.2. Google Login (No Session Found)1. If no session, the application displays a login screen.2. The primary call to action is a 'Sign in with Google' button.3. Upon clicking, the user is redirected to Google's authentication flow.4. Successful authentication redirects the user back to the application.### 2.3. Dashboard View (Authenticated)1. Upon successful login or if an existing session is detected, the user is directed to the main dashboard.2. The dashboard displays a welcome message and mock content cards, serving as placeholders for future features.## 3. UI States and Components### 3.1. Login Screen- Elements: Application Logo (optional), 'Welcome' or 'Sign In' header, 'Sign in with Google' button.- State: Initial, loading (during Google redirect), error (failed login).### 3.2. Dashboard Screen- Elements: 'Welcome to your Dashboard' header, content area with placeholder cards/text.- State: Default (displaying mock content).## 4. Copy- Login Screen: 'Welcome', 'Sign in with Google', 'Login failed. Please try again.'- Dashboard Screen: 'Welcome to your Dashboard', 'Your Latest Activity', 'Mock content goes here.'## 5. Error Handling- Google Login Failure: Display a temporary, non-intrusive message indicating login failure and prompting a retry. Do not block the UI indefinitely.## 6. Visuals & Interaction- Utilize Shadcn UI components for a clean, modern aesthetic.- The 'Sign in with Google' button should be clearly distinguishable and follow common Google branding guidelines (if possible within Shadcn constraints).- Dashboard content should be well-spaced and easy to read, even with placeholder text.",

  "validation_checklist": "1. **Predictability for New Users**:* Is the 'Sign in with Google' button immediately recognizable and its function obvious?* Does the transition from login to dashboard feel seamless and expected?* Is the purpose of the dashboard clear, even with mock content?2. **Timeliness of Information**:* Are all necessary instructions for login provided before the user needs them? (e.g., clear button text)* Are any error messages for login failures presented clearly and immediately?* Is the dashboard content structured to be easily digestible without prior explanation?3. **UI-Intent Match**:* Does the visual design (modern, clean, Shadcn-based) align with the intent of an 'intuitive and efficient initial user experience'?* Is the Google login flow frictionless and standard?* Does the basic dashboard layout support the idea of providing quick, at-a-glance information for a technically competent user?* Does the interface avoid unnecessary complexity or obscure elements, aligning with 'obvious without documentation'?",
  "summary": "The design for the core application foundation (error-fix-1770311013114) has been completed. It includes a clear design intent focused on an intuitive and efficient experience for technically competent users, a detailed design specification outlining the Google login flow and basic dashboard, and a wireframe JSON for the dashboard screen. A comprehensive validation checklist has been created to ensure alignment with product beliefs regarding predictability, timely information, and UI-intent matching. This output is ready for the Dev Agent to proceed with implementation."
