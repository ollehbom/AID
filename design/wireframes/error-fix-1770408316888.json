  "design_intent": "The design intent for the foundational frontend architecture is to establish a modern, consistent, and performant React application using Shadcn UI, integrated with Google login and a basic dashboard. This aims to provide a robust and intuitive UI/UX foundation that accelerates future feature development and aligns with core product beliefs: 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' and 'Users value speed over configurability'. The initial design focuses on a frictionless Google login experience and a clear, simple dashboard as the primary entry point after authentication.",
  "design_spec": "## Design Specification: Foundational Frontend (Login & Dashboard)\n\n### 1. User Flow\n1.  **Landing Page / Login:** User lands on the application's root URL.\n2.  **Google Login:** User sees a prominent 'Sign in with Google' button.\n3.  **Authentication:** User clicks the button, initiating the Google OAuth flow.\n4.  **Redirection:** Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the main Dashboard page.\n5.  **Dashboard Display:** User sees a basic dashboard with a greeting and placeholder content.\n\n### 2. States\n*   **Login Screen:**\n    *   **Initial:** Displays app title, a welcome message, and the 'Sign in with Google' button.\n    *   **Loading:** (Implicit during Google OAuth redirection) A brief loading indicator may be shown if the redirection is not instant.\n    *   **Error:** If Google login fails (e.g., network issue, Google error), a toast notification or inline message 'Login failed. Please try again.' appears.\n*   **Dashboard Screen:**\n    *   **Initial:** Displays a header (e.g., 'Dashboard'), a welcome message (e.g., 'Hello, [User Name]!'), and a content area with placeholder text or basic cards.\n    *   **Empty State:** If no dynamic content is available, a message like 'No content yet. Start by...' could be shown.\n\n### 3. Copy\n*   **Login Screen:**\n    *   App Title: 'Product Name'\n    *   Welcome Message: 'Welcome! Sign in to continue.'\n    *   Button Label: 'Sign in with Google'\n    *   Error Message: 'Login failed. Please try again.'\n*   **Dashboard Screen:**\n    *   Header: 'Dashboard'\n    *   Greeting: 'Hello, [User Name]!' (dynamic)\n    *   Placeholder Content: 'Your recent activity will appear here.' or 'Explore your data.'\n\n### 4. Error Handling\n*   **Google Login Failure:** If the Google OAuth process encounters an error (e.g., user cancels, network issue, API error), the user is returned to the Login Screen with a clear, non-intrusive error message (e.g., a toast notification) indicating the failure and suggesting to try again.\n*   **Dashboard Data Loading Failure:** If dashboard content fails to load, a polite message indicating the issue and an option to retry or contact support will be displayed in the content area.",

  "validation_checklist": "*   **Can a new user predict what happens next?** Yes. The prominent 'Sign in with Google' button clearly indicates the action required. Upon clicking, the expectation is to authenticate and then access the application, likely a dashboard. This aligns with the 'Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance' belief.\n*   **Is anything explained too late?** No. The login screen is the initial interaction and is self-explanatory for anyone familiar with Google login. Any necessary explanations (e.g., error messages) are provided immediately in context.\n*   **Does the UI match the intent?** Yes. The simple, clean login screen with a single clear call to action (Google login) directly supports the intent of an 'obvious without documentation' and 'speed over configurability' product. The minimal design reduces friction and cognitive load, establishing an intuitive UI/UX foundation.",
  "summary": "The design for feature 'error-fix-1770408316888' focuses on establishing a core frontend experience. It includes a streamlined Google login flow and a conceptual basic dashboard, designed to be intuitive and fast. The wireframe provided details the initial login screen. Validation confirms the design aligns with product beliefs by ensuring new users can predict interactions, all necessary information is presented timely, and the UI effectively matches the intent of a simple, obvious, and performant user experience."
