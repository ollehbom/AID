  "design_intent": "This foundational feature establishes the technical and experiential bedrock for all future user-facing development. Its primary purpose is to accelerate feature iteration and ensure a consistent, intuitive user experience from the outset. By integrating a React application with shadcn UI and Google login, we aim to reduce development overhead and reinforce the product belief that 'Users value speed over configurability' and 'The product must feel obvious without documentation.' The design prioritizes clarity and minimal friction for initial access, setting a standard for future UI development.",
  "design_spec": "### Design Specification: Dedicated Dev Environment#### 1. User Flow**1.1 Initial Access (Unauthenticated)***   **Action**: User navigates to the application URL.*   **System Response**: User is redirected to the \"Sign In\" page. The page clearly presents the option to sign in via Google.**1.2 Google Login***   **Action**: User clicks the \"Sign in with Google\" button.*   **System Response**: A Google authentication pop-up or redirect initiates the OAuth flow. Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the Dashboard page.*   **Error Handling**: If Google login fails (e.g., network issue, user cancels), a clear, non-intrusive error message is displayed on the Sign In page (e.g., \"Google sign-in failed. Please try again.\").**1.3 Dashboard Access (Authenticated)***   **Action**: User successfully logs in.*   **System Response**: User lands on the Dashboard page, which displays mock content to signify successful access and the application's basic structure. This page is minimal, focusing on layout and basic component integration (e.g., a simple header, a card component).#### 2. States**2.1 Sign In Page***   **Default**: \"Sign in with Google\" button visible and clickable.*   **Loading**: Button might show a loading spinner or be disabled during the authentication request.*   **Error**: Error message displayed if login fails. (e.g., \"Google sign-in failed.\")**2.2 Dashboard Page***   **Default**: Header, placeholder content card(s) visible.*   **Loading**: (Future consideration, not in initial scope)#### 3. Copy**3.1 Sign In Page***   **Main Heading**: \"Welcome to the App\" or \"Sign In\"*   **Call to Action**: \"Sign in with Google\"*   **Error Message**: \"Google sign-in failed. Please try again.\"#### 4. Component Usage (Shadcn UI)**4.1 Button*: Used for \"Sign in with Google\" action.*   **Variant**: Primary or outline, depending on visual hierarchy.*   **Size**: Appropriate for a prominent call to action.**4.2 Card*: Used for displaying mock content on the Dashboard (e.g., a simple info card).*   **Structure**: Header, optional subtitle, body text.#### 5. Accessibility Considerations*   Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for text and buttons.*   Provide ARIA labels for interactive elements.*   Keyboard navigation for login button and other interactives.#### 6. Future Considerations*   **Sign Out**: A basic sign-out mechanism will be added to the dashboard post-MVP.*   **User Profile**: Displaying user's name/email post-login (not in initial scope, but foundational for future personalization).",

  "validation_checklist": "- **Can a new user predict what happens next?** Yes. The prominent \"Sign in with Google\" button clearly indicates the next action. Upon successful login, navigation to a dashboard is a standard and predictable flow.- **Is anything explained too late?** No. The sign-in prompt is immediate upon accessing the application, and the purpose of the button is self-explanatory. Any necessary information (e.g., error messages) is displayed contextually and immediately.- **Does the UI match the intent?** Yes. The design prioritizes a simple, direct, and obvious login experience, aligning with the product beliefs that \"Users value speed over configurability\" and \"The product must feel obvious without documentation.\" The foundational design with shadcn UI (implied by the product decision) aims for consistency and reduced friction, supporting faster future iteration.",
  "summary": "The design for the dedicated-dev-env feature focuses on establishing a clear and minimal sign-in experience using Google authentication, followed by access to a basic dashboard. This directly supports the product intent of creating a fast, consistent, and intuitive application foundation that accelerates future feature development. Validation confirms the user flow is predictable, timely, and aligns with core product beliefs regarding speed, obviousness, and consistency without requiring extensive documentation."
