  "design_intent": "This feature exists to resolve critical issues within the product's foundational user interface, specifically addressing scenarios where core functionalities like Google login or initial dashboard load fail. The intent is to provide clear, actionable feedback to the user when an error occurs, preventing frustration and guiding them towards resolution or retry, thus upholding the belief that 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' even in failure states.",

Complete User FlowGoal: User encounters an error during foundational interaction (e.g., login, initial dashboard load) and receives clear guidance.1. Error Encountered: During Google login or initial dashboard rendering, a critical error occurs.2. Error Display: The application displays a dedicated error screen.3. User Action: User may attempt a retry.2. StatesError State:Visuals: Clear, prominent error message.Content:Headline: \"Something went wrong\"Body: \"We encountered an unexpected issue. Please try again.\"Call to Action: \"Retry\" button.Interactions: \"Retry\" button attempts the failed operation again.3. CopyHeadline: \"Something went wrong\"Body: \"We encountered an unexpected issue. Please try again.\"Button: \"Retry\"4.

  "validation_checklist": "1. Predictability: Does the error message clearly state an error occurred? Is the suggested action ('Retry') obvious? Can a user predict that clicking 'Retry' will re-attempt the previous action?2. Timeliness of Explanation: Is the error message displayed immediately upon error detection? Is the explanation for the error (generic issue) and the next step ('Please try again') provided upfront?3. UI-Intent Match: Does the UI (simple error screen with 'Retry' button) provide clear, actionable feedback to prevent frustration? Does it guide the user towards resolution (retry)? Does it align with the belief that 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' even in failure states?",
  "summary": "Designed a minimalistic error screen and flow (feature ID: error-fix-1770413379323) to provide clear, actionable feedback to users encountering critical issues during foundational UI interactions like Google login or initial dashboard load. The design focuses on simplicity, immediate feedback, and a clear 'Retry' call to action, ensuring the product remains intuitive even in error states. This aligns with core beliefs about obviousness and intuitive onboarding."
