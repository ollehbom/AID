  "design_intent": "# Design Intent: Foundational UI & Experience (Feature ID: error-fix-1770404394248)\n\n## Why this feature exists\n\nThis foundational feature exists to establish the core user interface and experience for the application. It provides a modern, intuitive entry point and a basic navigation structure, directly addressing the lack of a core UI/UX foundation that currently prevents user interaction and subsequent feature development.\n\n## How it should feel\n\nThe user experience should feel:\n\n- **Obvious and Intuitive**: A new user should immediately understand how to sign in and what the dashboard presents, without needing any documentation or guidance. This directly aligns with the core belief \"The product must feel obvious without documentation.\"\n- **Modern and Polished**: Leveraging Shadcn components, the UI should convey a professional and contemporary aesthetic, inspiring confidence in the product's quality and future potential.\n- **Effortless**: The Google login process should be seamless and quick, removing any friction for initial access.\n- **Consistent**: The initial design system components should lay the groundwork for a unified visual language across the application, making future feature integration feel cohesive.\n\n## Core Interactions\n\n1.  **Sign-in**: User lands on a clear sign-in page. A prominent \"Sign in with Google\" button is the primary call to action.\n2.  **Dashboard Access**: Upon successful sign-in, the user is directed to a basic dashboard. This dashboard serves as a welcoming hub and a placeholder for future content.\n\n## Success Metrics (Design Perspective)\n\n- **Predictability**: A new user can predict what happens after clicking \"Sign in with Google\" (i.e., Google's auth flow, then dashboard).\n- **Clarity**: No ambiguity in the sign-in process or dashboard layout.\n- **Frictionless**: The journey from landing page to dashboard feels smooth and uninterrupted.\n- **Alignment with Beliefs**: The design clearly reflects the belief that \"the product must feel obvious without documentation.\"",
  "design_spec": "# Design Specification: Foundational UI & Experience (Feature ID: error-fix-1770404394248)\n\n## 1. Overview / Goal\nThe objective is to create the core user interface and experience for the application, enabling users to sign in via Google and access a basic dashboard. This foundational work will leverage Shadcn for a modern UI and establish an initial design system to ensure consistency and accelerate future development.\n\n## 2. User Flow\n\n### Flow: Initial Access & Dashboard\n**Actor**: New or returning user\n**Trigger**: User navigates to the application URL.\n\n1.  **Landing Page / Sign-in Screen**\n    *   **State**: Initial load.\n    *   **UI**:\n        *   App Title/Logo (e.g., \"My Awesome App\").\n        *   Clear prompt: \"Sign in to continue\" or \"Welcome back\".\n        *   Primary Action: \"Sign in with Google\" button.\n    *   **Interaction**: User clicks \"Sign in with Google\".\n    *   **System Action**: Initiates Google OAuth flow.\n\n2.  **Google Authentication (External)**\n    *   **State**: Redirected to Google's authentication page.\n    *   **UI**: Google's standard login/consent screen.\n    *   **Interaction**: User selects/confirms Google account.\n    *   **System Action**: Google authenticates user and redirects back to the application with auth token.\n\n3.  **Dashboard Screen**\n    *   **State**: User successfully authenticated.\n    *   **UI**:\n        *   Header: \"Dashboard\".\n        *   Welcome message: \"Welcome, [User Name]!\" (Placeholder for actual user name).\n        *   Basic content area (e.g., a card or section for \"Your Activity\", \"Quick Links\" - with placeholder text).\n        *   No complex navigation initially, focus on core content.\n    *   **Interaction**: User views dashboard.\n    *   **System Action**: Displays user-specific (or generic) dashboard content.\n\n## 3. UI Components & Design System (Initial)\n\n### General\n-   **Typography**: Define primary font stack, heading sizes (H1, H2, H3), body text, and caption styles.\n-   **Colors**: Define primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, error, and neutral palettes.\n-   **Spacing**: Establish a consistent spacing scale (e.g., 4px or 8px grid).\n\n### Specific Components\n-   **Button**:\n    *   **Types**: Primary (for \"Sign in with Google\"), Secondary (if needed for future actions).\n    *   **States**: Default, Hover, Focus, Active, Disabled, Loading.\n    *   **Styling**: Shadcn button component with defined variants.\n-   **Input**: (Not directly used in this initial flow, but part of design system)\n    *   **Types**: Text, Email, Password.\n    *   **States**: Default, Focus, Error, Disabled.\n    *   **Styling**: Shadcn input component.\n-   **Card**: (For dashboard content)\n    *   **Styling**: Shadcn card component with shadow/border, padding, rounded corners.\n-   **Layout**:\n    *   Basic page layout with responsive considerations (mobile-first approach).\n    *   Centered content for sign-in screen.\n    *   Standard header/body layout for dashboard.\n\n## 4. Copy\n\n### Sign-in Screen\n-   **App Title**: \"My Awesome App\" (Placeholder)\n-   **Prompt**: \"Sign in to continue\"\n-   **Button**: \"Sign in with Google\"\n\n### Dashboard Screen\n-   **Header**: \"Dashboard\"\n-   **Welcome**: \"Welcome, [User Name]!\"\n-   **Placeholder Content**: \"Your content will appear here. Get started by exploring...\"\n\n## 5. Error Handling (Initial)\n\n-   **Google Sign-in Failure**:\n    *   **Scenario**: User cancels Google login, or Google authentication fails.\n    *   **UI**: Redirect back to the Sign-in Screen.\n    *   **Message**: A temporary, non-intrusive toast or message below the button: \"Sign-in failed. Please try again.\" (or specific error if available from Google).\n-   **Network/API Errors**: (Beyond current scope, but to be considered for future)\n\n## 6. Accessibility Considerations\n\n-   Ensure all interactive elements (buttons) are keyboard navigable.\n-   Provide clear focus states for interactive elements.\n-   Use semantic HTML for screen readers.\n-   Ensure sufficient color contrast.",

  "summary": "The Design Agent has translated the product decision for the foundational UI into a detailed design. The `design_intent` outlines the goal of an obvious, modern, and effortless experience, aligning with the core belief that \"the product must feel obvious without documentation.\" The `design_spec` details the user flow for Google sign-in and dashboard access, including UI states, initial design system components (buttons, typography, colors), and basic error handling. A simple `wireframe_json` for the login screen provides a structural guide for development. The `validation_checklist` ensures the design can be evaluated against predictability, clarity, UI-intent match, and the core product belief, aiming to identify any friction or mismatches before development proceeds. This output provides a clear and actionable blueprint for the Dev Agent to implement the core frontend foundation."
