  "design_spec": "## Design Specification for Feature: Foundational UI (error-fix-1770311582083)\n\n### 1. User Flow\n\n**Flow A: Unauthenticated User Login**\n1.  **Entry Point**: User navigates to the application URL.\n2.  **Login Screen Display**: The application presents a dedicated login screen.\n3.  **Google Authentication**: User clicks 'Sign in with Google'.\n4.  **Google OAuth Flow**: User is redirected to Google for authentication and authorization.\n5.  **Successful Authentication**: Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the application.\n6.  **Dashboard Access**: User is immediately directed to the main dashboard screen.\n\n### 2. UI States & Components\n\n**A. Login Screen**\n*   **Name**: LoginScreen\n*   **Elements**:\n    *   **Header**: 'Welcome to My Product' (Text, large, centered)\n    *   **Subheader**: 'Please sign in to continue' (Text, medium, centered)\n    *   **Google Sign-In Button**: 'Sign in with Google' (Primary action button, centered)\n*   **States**:\n    *   **Default**: Displaying header, subheader, and button.\n    *   **Loading**: After clicking 'Sign in with Google', button displays a loading spinner or 'Signing in...' text. (Optional: Overlay with loading indicator for full screen).\n    *   **Error**: If Google authentication fails (e.g., network issue, permission denied), a transient toast or inline message 'Login failed. Please try again.' appears.\n\n**B. Dashboard Screen (Post-Login)**\n*   **Name**: DashboardScreen\n*   **Elements**:\n    *   **Header**: 'Dashboard' (Text, prominent, left-aligned)\n    *   **Welcome Card**: A card component displaying 'Welcome to your new dashboard!' and a brief message like 'This is a foundational view. More features coming soon.'\n    *   **Placeholder Content**: One or more placeholder cards/sections (e.g., 'Your Data' with a generic content block) to demonstrate layout and extensibility.\n*   **States**:\n    *   **Loading**: A skeleton screen or loading indicator displayed while initial dashboard data (if any) is fetched.\n    *   **Default**: Displaying header and content cards.\n    *   **Empty State**: If dynamic content areas have no data, appropriate 'No data yet' messages.\n\n### 3. Copy\n*   **Login Screen**:\n    *   Header: 'Welcome to My Product'\n    *   Subheader: 'Please sign in to continue'\n    *   Button: 'Sign in with Google'\n    *   Error Message: 'Login failed. Please try again.'\n*   **Dashboard Screen**:\n    *   Header: 'Dashboard'\n    *   Welcome Card Title: 'Welcome to your new dashboard!'\n    *   Welcome Card Body: 'This is a foundational view. More features coming soon.'\n    *   Placeholder Title (example): 'Your Data'\n\n### 4. Error Handling\n*   **Google Login Failure**: Display a clear, non-intrusive message (e.g., a toast notification) indicating authentication failure and suggesting a retry. Do not block the UI.\n*   **Dashboard Data Loading Errors**: Display an error message within the affected card/section, offering a retry mechanism if applicable, or a general error message if the entire dashboard fails to load.",

  "validation_checklist": "## Validation Checklist for Foundational UI (error-fix-1770311582083)\n\n### General Validation\n*   **Can a new user predict what happens next?**\n    *   **Login Screen**: Yes, the 'Sign in with Google' button clearly indicates the immediate action. The expectation is to be logged in and directed to the main application.\n    *   **Post-Login**: Yes, upon successful login, the user is directly taken to a 'Dashboard' which is a predictable next step for a core application.\n*   **Is anything explained too late?**\n    *   **Login Screen**: No, the screen is minimal and self-explanatory. The purpose is clear.\n    *   **Dashboard Screen**: No, the initial dashboard provides a clear 'Welcome' and indicates its foundational nature, managing expectations without needing complex explanations.\n*   **Does the UI match the intent?**\n    *   **Modern & Robust Foundation**: The use of Shadcn UI (implied by the product decision) and a clean, structured wireframe aligns with the intent to build a modern and robust foundation.\n    *   **Efficient Development & Positive Initial UX**: The simple, clear flow and minimal design reduce potential friction, supporting efficient future development and a positive first impression.\n    *   **Obvious Without Documentation**: The direct Google login and straightforward dashboard layout are designed to be intuitive, requiring no external documentation for basic use.\n\n### Specific Flow Validation (Login)\n*   **Clarity of Action**: Is the 'Sign in with Google' button visually prominent and clear?\n*   **Feedback on Interaction**: Is there visual feedback (e.g., loading state) when the Google Sign-In button is pressed?\n*   **Error Handling Feedback**: Are login errors communicated clearly and concisely to the user without being disruptive?\n\n### Specific Flow Validation (Dashboard)\n*   **Immediate Orientation**: Does the dashboard clearly present itself as the main hub upon arrival (e.g., with a prominent 'Dashboard' title)?\n*   **Placeholder Clarity**: Are placeholder sections clearly labeled or designed to indicate future content without causing confusion?\n*   **Consistency**: Does the overall look and feel (implied by Shadcn) maintain consistency with the login screen, reinforcing a unified product experience?",
  "summary": "This design establishes the foundational user interface for the product, focusing on a clear and intuitive Google login flow leading to a basic, welcoming dashboard. The design prioritizes simplicity and predictability to minimize user friction and align with the product belief that the experience should feel 'obvious without documentation'. The wireframe provides a clean login screen, setting a professional tone and enabling a robust, extensible foundation for future feature development. Validation ensures new users can easily navigate the authentication process and understand the initial purpose of the dashboard, fulfilling the core intent of a positive and efficient initial user experience."
