  "design_intent": "The design intent for the foundational React application is to establish a modern, intuitive, and high-performance user interface that directly supports the core product beliefs: 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' and 'Users value speed over configurability'. This involves creating a seamless Google login experience and a clear, minimal dashboard. The integration of shadcn/ui and a foundational design system aims to accelerate future development while ensuring visual consistency and a predictable user experience from the outset, minimizing friction for our technically competent users.",
  "design_spec": "## Foundational UI/UX Design Specification: React Application, Google Login, Dashboard, and Design System### 1. Core Application Structure- **Technology**: React with shadcn/ui.- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach, adapting to larger screens.### 2. Google Login Flow- **Entry Point**: A prominent 'Sign in with Google' button on the initial landing/login screen.- **Interaction**: Clicking the button initiates the Google OAuth flow.- **States**:  - **Loading**: Visual indicator during authentication process.  - **Success**: Redirect to the main dashboard.- **Error**: Clear, concise error message displayed if login fails, with an option to retry.### 3. Basic Dashboard- **Layout**: Simple, clean layout, providing a welcoming message and space for future content.- **Elements**:  - **Header**: Application title or logo.  - **Welcome Message**: Personalized greeting (e.g., 'Welcome, [User Name]!').  - **Placeholder Content**: A card or section indicating where future features will appear (e.g., 'Your projects will appear here.').- **Navigation**: Minimal or no primary navigation initially, focusing on the core purpose.### 4. Initial Design System- **Components**: Utilize shadcn/ui components for all UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) to ensure consistency and accelerate development.- **Typography**: Define primary and secondary fonts, sizes, and weights for headings, body text, and labels.- **Color Palette**: Establish a core set of brand colors (primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, error, neutral tones).- **Spacing**: Define a consistent spacing scale for margins, padding, and component separation.- **Iconography**: Basic set of common icons (e.g., user, settings, logout) if needed.### 5. Error Handling- **General**: Consistent visual feedback for all errors (e.g., toasts, inline messages, dedicated error screens).- **Login Errors**: Specific messages for authentication failures (e.g., 'Google login failed. Please try again.').",

  "validation_checklist": "1.  **New User Predictability**:  - Can a new user immediately understand the purpose of the 'Sign in with Google' button?  - Is it clear what happens after successful login (i.e., landing on the dashboard)?  - Are error messages (e.g., login failure) self-explanatory and actionable?2.  **Timeliness of Explanations**:  - Are all necessary instructions or feedback (e.g., loading states, error messages) presented at the appropriate moment, not too late?  - Is the dashboard's purpose immediately obvious without needing further guidance?3.  **UI-Intent Match**:  - Does the UI feel 'obvious without documentation' through its simplicity and clarity?  - Does the design prioritize 'speed over configurability' by offering a streamlined experience (e.g., direct Google login, minimal dashboard)?  - Is the shadcn/ui integration consistent and contribute to a modern, clean aesthetic?  - Do the visual cues (colors, typography, spacing) align with a technically competent user's expectation of a robust tool?  - Is the overall experience free of unnecessary friction during the login and initial dashboard view?",
  "summary": "The design for the foundational React application, encompassing Google login and a basic dashboard, has been defined. The design intent focuses on creating an intuitive, fast, and consistent user experience, leveraging shadcn/ui and a foundational design system to accelerate future development and align with core product beliefs. A simple error screen wireframe has been provided to address potential issues. The design has been validated against predictability, timely explanations, and alignment with product intent, ensuring a solid UI/UX groundwork."
