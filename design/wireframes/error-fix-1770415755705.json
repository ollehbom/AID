  "design_intent": "# Design Intent for Initial UI Foundation (error-fix-1770415755705)\n\n### 1. Why does this feature exist?\nThis feature establishes the foundational user interface (UI) for the product, providing a consistent, modern, and functional platform for all future features. This initial build includes a login screen with Google authentication and a basic dashboard.\n\n### 2. What is the user's core need this design addresses?\nUsers (especially technical users/developers) need a clear, intuitive, and secure way to access the product. They also need a basic entry point (dashboard) to interact with the system once authenticated.\n\n### 3. How should the user feel when interacting with this feature?\n*   **Confident:** That their login is secure and straightforward.\n*   **Oriented:** They know where they are and what they can generally do on the dashboard.\n*   **Unimpeded:** The UI should not present any friction or ambiguity.\n*   **Modern & Professional:** The aesthetic should feel up-to-date and reliable.\n\n### 4. What problem does this design solve?\n*   Lack of a consistent and functional UI foundation.\n*   Absence of a secure and straightforward user authentication mechanism.\n*   Inability to rapidly develop and iterate on future user-facing features due to a missing design system.\n\n### 5. What product beliefs does this design validate or support?\n*   **Core Belief:** \"The product must feel obvious without documentation.\" This design aims to make the login process and basic dashboard navigation inherently understandable.\n*   **Hypothesis Support:** \"a foundational React application styled with Shadcn UI... Will result in a rapid development cycle for subsequent features and a consistent, modern user experience.\"\n\n### 6. Key user flows and moments of interaction:\n*   **Login:** User lands on the login page, sees the \"Sign in with Google\" option, clicks it, authenticates via Google, and is redirected to the dashboard.\n*   **Dashboard View:** User lands on a dashboard displaying mock content, indicating successful access and a basic overview.",
  "design_spec": "# Design Specification: Initial UI Foundation (error-fix-1770415755705)\n\n## 1. Feature Overview\nThis specification details the design for the foundational UI elements: a login screen with Google authentication and a basic dashboard. The goal is to establish a clear, consistent, and intuitive user experience using React and Shadcn UI, adhering to the core belief that \"The product must feel obvious without documentation.\"\n\n## 2. Components & Design System\n*   **Framework**: React\n*   **UI Library**: Shadcn UI (components will leverage Shadcn's styling and structure)\n*   **Design Principles**: Simplicity, clarity, consistency, responsiveness.\n\n## 3. User Flows\n\n### 3.1. Login Flow\n\n**Scenario**: New or unauthenticated user attempts to access the application.\n\n1.  **State: Landing Page / Unauthenticated**\n    *   **Description**: User arrives at the application's root URL or attempts to access a protected route without authentication.\n    *   **UI Elements**:\n        *   Application Title/Logo (e.g., \"My Product\")\n        *   Welcome/Instructional Text (e.g., \"Sign in to continue\", \"Welcome back!\")\n        *   \"Sign in with Google\" button (Shadcn Button component, `variant=\"default\"` or `variant=\"outline\"` with Google icon)\n    *   **Interactions**:\n        *   Clicking \"Sign in with Google\" button initiates the Google OAuth flow.\n    *   **Error Handling**:\n        *   If Google authentication fails: Display a temporary toast/notification (Shadcn Toast) \"Authentication failed. Please try again.\"\n\n2.  **State: Google Authentication in Progress**\n    *   **Description**: User is redirected to Google's authentication page or a pop-up appears.\n    *   **UI Elements**: Handled by Google.\n    *   **Interactions**: User completes Google's authentication steps.\n\n3.  **State: Post-Authentication Redirect**\n    *   **Description**: After successful Google authentication, the user is redirected back to the application.\n    *   **UI Elements**: Loading indicator (Shadcn Spinner/Skeleton) can be shown briefly before the dashboard renders.\n    *   **Interactions**: Automatic redirection to the Dashboard.\n\n### 3.2. Dashboard View Flow\n\n**Scenario**: Authenticated user accesses the main application dashboard.\n\n1.  **State: Dashboard Display**\n    *   **Description**: The primary landing page for authenticated users. Displays essential information or entry points.\n    *   **UI Elements**:\n        *   **Header**:\n            *   Application Name/Logo (left)\n            *   User Profile/Avatar (right, e.g., Shadcn Avatar component)\n            *   Logout Button (e.g., Shadcn Button, `variant=\"ghost\"`)\n        *   **Main Content Area**:\n            *   Welcome Message (e.g., \"Welcome, [User Name]!\")\n            *   Placeholder Card/Section (e.g., Shadcn Card component) with mock content:\n                *   Title: \"Your Recent Activity\"\n                *   Body: \"No activity yet. Get started by exploring features.\"\n            *   (Optional) Basic Navigation (e.g., Shadcn Tabs or Nav component) with placeholder items like \"Overview\", \"Settings\".\n    *   **Interactions**:\n        *   Clicking User Profile/Avatar: (Future) Opens a profile menu.\n        *   Clicking Logout: Initiates logout process, redirects to Login Screen.\n        *   Clicking Navigation Items: (Future) Navigates to respective sections (currently mock).\n\n## 4. Copy & Messaging\n*   **Login Screen**:\n    *   Title: \"My Product\"\n    *   Subtitle: \"Sign in to continue\"\n    *   Button: \"Sign in with Google\"\n    *   Error: \"Authentication failed. Please try again.\"\n*   **Dashboard Screen**:\n    *   Header Title: \"Dashboard\"\n    *   Welcome: \"Welcome, [User Name]!\"\n    *   Card Title: \"Your Recent Activity\"\n    *   Card Body: \"No activity yet. Get started by exploring features.\"\n\n## 5. Error Handling\n*   **Login Failure**: Display a temporary `Toast` notification (e.g., \"Authentication failed. Please try again.\") and keep the user on the login screen.\n*   **API Errors (Future)**: General error display pattern using Shadcn `Alert` or `Toast` components.\n\n## 6. Responsiveness\n*   The UI should be responsive and functional across common mobile and desktop breakpoints. Shadcn components are inherently responsive, but specific layouts will need verification.\n\n## 7. Accessibility\n*   All interactive elements should have appropriate ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support, leveraging Shadcn's built-in accessibility features.",

  "summary": "The design for the initial UI foundation (login and basic dashboard) has been completed. The design prioritizes clarity, consistency, and a modern user experience through the use of Shadcn UI. A simple wireframe for the login screen has been provided, along with detailed design intent and specifications. The design aims to make the product feel obvious without documentation, aligning with core product beliefs. This output is ready for the Dev Agent to proceed with implementation."
