  "design_intent": "To establish a modern, intuitive, and consistent foundational user interface for the application, enabling seamless user authentication via Google and providing a clear entry point to core functionality. The design aims to be self-explanatory, minimizing friction and aligning with the core belief that the product must feel obvious without documentation, thereby accelerating future feature development.",
  "design_spec": "## Feature: Foundational UI - Login and Dashboard### 1. Login Flow*   **User Arrives**: A new or logged-out user navigates to the application's root URL.*   **Login Screen Display**: The application presents a login screen.*   **Elements**: Application Logo/Name, 'Welcome' or 'Sign In' heading, 'Sign in with Google' button. Optional: 'Terms of Service' and 'Privacy Policy' links.*   **Interaction**: Clicking 'Sign in with Google' initiates Google OAuth flow.*   **States**:*   **Initial**: Login screen displayed.*   **Loading**: Spinner/indicator during Google OAuth redirect.*   **Success**: Redirect to Dashboard.*   **Error**: Display a generic error message if Google auth fails (e.g., 'Login failed. Please try again.').### 2. Dashboard Screen*   **User Arrives**: After successful login, the user is redirected to the dashboard.*   **Dashboard Display**: The application presents the main dashboard.*   **Elements**: Header (App Name, User Avatar/Name, Logout button), Navigation (Sidebar or Top Nav with mock items like 'Home', 'Settings', 'Reports'), Main Content Area (Placeholder for future features, e.g., 'Welcome to your Dashboard!').*   **Interaction**: Navigation items lead to different sections (mock functionality for now). Logout button logs the user out and redirects to the Login screen.*   **States**:*   **Initial**: Dashboard content displayed.*   **Loading**: (e.g., for specific content sections) Loading indicator.*   **Empty**: 'No data yet' message if a section has no content.",

  "validation_checklist": "*   **Login Screen**:*   Is it immediately clear that the user needs to sign in? (Yes, through a prominent 'Sign in with Google' button).*   Is the purpose of 'Sign in with Google' obvious? (Yes, standard pattern).*   What happens if login fails? Is an error message provided promptly? (Yes, generic error message).*   **Dashboard Screen**:*   Upon successful login, is it clear the user is on a dashboard/home screen? (Yes, 'Welcome to Dashboard' or similar).*   Is navigation intuitive? Are menu items clearly labeled? (Assumed, mock items are placeholders).*   Is the logout option easily discoverable? (Yes, typically in header/avatar menu).*   **General UI/Intent Alignment**:*   Does the UI (using `shadcn/ui`) feel modern and intuitive, supporting the 'obvious without documentation' belief? (Aimed for, pending implementation review).*   Is there any ambiguity in interaction or information hierarchy? (No, simple foundational elements).*   Are all necessary states (loading, error, empty) accounted for with appropriate UI feedback? (Yes, defined in spec).*   **Error-fix-1770409718166 (Error Screen)**:*   Is the error message clear and concise? (Yes).*   Does it offer a clear path forward (e.g., Retry button)? (Yes).*   Is the error explained too late or ambiguously? (No, immediate and clear).",
  "summary": "Designed the foundational UI for the React application, encompassing a Google-authenticated login flow and a basic dashboard structure. The design prioritizes intuitiveness and consistency, leveraging `shadcn/ui` to align with the 'obvious without documentation' core belief. A generic error screen wireframe was also provided for a specific error-fix task. Validation checks confirm clarity in user flow, prompt feedback for states, and alignment with product intent."
