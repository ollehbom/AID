  "design_intent": "This design establishes the absolute foundational user interface for the product, enabling Google authentication and a basic dashboard. The core intent is to provide an obvious and functional entry point for early users, allowing for initial interaction, validation of future core product beliefs, and gathering foundational feedback. It aims to make the initial experience feel intuitive and require no prior documentation.",
  "design_spec": "The user flow begins with navigation to the application URL. If unauthenticated, the user is presented with a simple login screen featuring a 'Sign in with Google' button. Clicking this button initiates the Google OAuth flow. Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to a basic dashboard page displaying a 'Welcome' message and placeholder content. Error handling for failed authentication will present a generic, user-friendly message. The design prioritizes clarity and minimal steps to ensure a smooth initial user experience.",

  "validation_checklist": "1. Can a new user predict that clicking 'Sign in with Google' will initiate the authentication process? (Yes, clear button label and context). 2. Is anything explained too late? (No, the login screen is the primary entry point; instructions are minimal and direct). 3. Does the UI match the intent of providing a simple, obvious entry point? (Yes, a single, prominent action button for login directly supports this intent). 4. Is the transition from unauthenticated to authenticated state clear and seamless for the user? 5. Does the post-login dashboard clearly indicate a successful entry and a starting point for interaction?",
  "summary": "The design for the foundational UI successfully translates the product intent into a direct and intuitive user experience. It provides a clear login path via Google authentication and a minimalist dashboard, serving as the essential interactive surface. The design prioritizes user predictability and clarity, laying a solid groundwork for future feature development and belief validation."
