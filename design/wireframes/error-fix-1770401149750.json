  "validation_checklist": "1.  **Clarity of Login Action**: Is the \"Login with Google\" button clearly identifiable and its purpose obvious to a new user?\n2.  **Predictability of Flow (Login -> Dashboard)**: Does the UI imply that a successful login will lead directly to a dashboard or main application view?\n3.  **Absence of Friction/Confusion**: Are there any elements that might cause hesitation or require external documentation?\n4.  **Alignment with \"Obvious without documentation\"**: Does the login and initial dashboard experience require any explicit instructions or hints?\n5.  **Simplicity & Intuitiveness**: Is the overall design simple enough to be intuitive for a technically competent user?",
  "summary": "The design for the Core Application UI focuses on establishing a minimal yet intuitive initial user experience. It provides a clear path for Google login, adhering to the product belief that the experience must feel 'obvious without documentation'. The wireframe outlines a simple login screen, designed to be easily predictable for new users, leading them to the core application views without confusion or friction. The design aims to validate the intuitiveness of the onboarding flow from the very first interaction."
