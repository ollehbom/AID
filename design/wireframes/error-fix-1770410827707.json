Yes, \"Sign in to access your dashboard.\" - Is the dashboard content self-explanatory as a placeholder? Yes, \"Your content will appear here.\" - Does the design system (shadcn) ensure visual consistency and professionalism? Yes, by definition of using a modern design system.",
  "summary": "The Design Agent has created the foundational UI design for feature `error-fix-1770410827707`. This includes a clear login flow via Google and a basic dashboard placeholder, all designed to leverage a modern design system (shadcn). The design intent is to provide an intuitive and professional initial user experience, directly supporting the core product belief that the product must feel obvious without documentation. The design spec details the two main screens (LoginScreen, DashboardScreen), their components, states, and copy. The validation checklist confirms that the design addresses user predictability, timely explanations, and alignment with the product's core intent. The wireframe JSON provides a structural representation for the LoginScreen, ready for the Dev Agent."
