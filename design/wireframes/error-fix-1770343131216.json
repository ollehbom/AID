  "design_intent": "This design exists to establish the essential user interface and authentication mechanism for the product's Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Its primary purpose is to provide a functional entry point for technically competent users, allowing them to securely log in via Google and access a basic dashboard. This foundation is crucial for validating core product beliefs, particularly that users expect a modern, intuitive interface and that the primary user is technically competent. It sets the stage for future feature development and user testing by providing the necessary interactive platform.",
  "design_spec": "# Design Specification: Core Application Foundation (error-fix-1770343131216)\n\n## 1. User Flow: Application Access & Google Login\n\n**Goal**: Allow a new user to access the application and securely log in using their Google account to reach a basic dashboard.\n\n### 1.1. Initial Access (Logged Out State)\n- **Screen**: Welcome/Login Page\n- **Elements**:\n    - App Header/Logo (e.g., \"Welcome to [App Name]\")\n    - Brief introductory text (e.g., \"Sign in to get started.\")\n    - \"Sign in with Google\" button.\n- **Interaction**: User clicks \"Sign in with Google\".\n\n### 1.2. Google Authentication\n- **Interaction**: Upon clicking the button, a Google OAuth consent screen/popup appears (handled by Google's SDK).\n- **States**:\n    - **Pending**: Loading indicator during authentication.\n    - **Success**: User is redirected to the Dashboard.\n    - **Failure**: Error message displayed on the Login Page (e.g., \"Google login failed. Please try again.\").\n\n### 1.3. Dashboard (Logged In State)\n- **Screen**: Dashboard\n- **Elements**:\n    - App Header (e.g., \"Dashboard\")\n    - Simple greeting (e.g., \"Hello, [User Name]!\")\n    - Placeholder content (e.g., \"Your journey starts here. More features coming soon!\").\n    - A \"Sign Out\" button (for future implementation, initially just the content).\n- **Interaction**: User can view mock content.\n\n## 2. Visual & Interaction Design\n- **Styling**: Utilizes Shadcn UI components for a clean, modern aesthetic.\n- **Responsiveness**: Basic responsiveness for mobile-first view (375px width, 812px height as base).\n- **Typography**: Standard Shadcn typography.\n- **Colors**: Default Shadcn theme, focusing on accessibility and clarity.\n\n## 3. Error Handling\n- **Google Login Failure**: Display a clear, concise error message on the login screen. No complex recovery flow needed for MVP.\n- **API Errors (Post-login)**: Not in scope for this foundational MVP, assume dashboard content loads successfully.\n\n## 4. Copy\n- **Login Page Header**: \"Welcome\"\n- **Login Page Subtitle**: \"Sign in to get started\"\n- **Login Button**: \"Sign in with Google\"\n- **Dashboard Header**: \"Dashboard\"\n- **Dashboard Greeting**: \"Hello, [User Name]!\"\n- **Dashboard Content**: \"Your journey starts here. More features coming soon!\"\n- **Login Error**: \"Login failed. Please try again.\"",

  "validation_checklist": "- **Can a new user predict what happens next?**\n    - Yes, the \"Sign in with Google\" button clearly indicates the action. Upon clicking, a user would expect a Google authentication flow.\n    - Post-login, the \"Dashboard\" title and simple content suggest a landing area for further interaction.\n- **Is anything explained too late?**\n    - No. The initial screen immediately presents the login option. Any necessary explanations for Google login are handled by Google's own UI.\n    - The purpose of the basic dashboard is clear as a placeholder for future features.\n- **Does the UI match the intent?**\n    - Yes. The UI is minimal, focusing solely on authentication and providing a basic entry point. This matches the intent of establishing a foundational MVP for technically competent users. The use of Shadcn UI also aligns with the intent of a modern, intuitive interface.",
  "summary": "The design intent, specification, and wireframe for the core application foundation (error-fix-1770343131216) have been completed. The design focuses on a clear Google login flow leading to a basic dashboard, aligning with the product's MVP goals and the belief that users are technically competent and expect a modern interface. The validation confirms the design is intuitive, clear, and directly supports the stated product intent. This output is ready for the Dev Agent to implement."
