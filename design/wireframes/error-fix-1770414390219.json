  "design_intent": "## Design Intent: Establish Foundational UI/UX (error-fix-1770414390219)\n\n### Why this exists\nThis foundational feature exists to establish the absolute core of our product's user interface and experience. It directly addresses the founder's directive to build a basic React application, integrate a modern styling framework (shadcn/ui), implement a Google login flow, and a simple dashboard. This provides the essential scaffold for all future feature development.\n\n### How it should feel\nThe user experience should feel:\n*   **Obvious and Intuitive**: A new user should immediately understand how to sign in and what the dashboard presents, requiring no external documentation.\n*   **Fast and Responsive**: Interactions, especially the login process and dashboard loading, should be quick and seamless, reinforcing the belief that 'Users value speed over configurability'.\n*   **Visually Consistent and Modern**: Leveraging shadcn/ui, the UI should present a clean, professional, and contemporary aesthetic that is consistent across all states and components.\n*   **Secure and Trustworthy**: The Google login flow should instill confidence in the user regarding data security and privacy.\n*   **Minimalist**: The initial dashboard should be clean and uncluttered, focusing only on essential elements to avoid overwhelming the user and align with the 'basic dashboard' requirement.\n\n### Core components and their purpose\n*   **Google Login**: To provide a simple, widely-used, and secure authentication mechanism, reducing friction for new users.\n*   **Basic Dashboard**: To serve as the primary landing page post-authentication, offering a clear starting point for user interaction and future feature integration.\n*   **React Application & shadcn/ui**: To establish a robust, maintainable, and rapidly extensible frontend development environment with a consistent design system.",
  "design_spec": "## Design Specification: Establish Foundational UI/UX (error-fix-1770414390219)\n\n### 1. Complete User Flow (Step-by-Step)\n\n#### Scenario: First-time user / Unauthenticated User\n1.  **User Access**: User navigates to the application's base URL (e.g., `app.product.com`).\n2.  **Authentication Check**: The system checks for an existing authentication token or session.\n3.  **Display Login Screen**: If no valid session is found, the system presents the `LoginScreen`.\n    *   **Elements**: Application logo/name, a prominent 'Welcome' message, and a 'Sign in with Google' button.\n    *   **Action**: User clicks the 'Sign in with Google' button.\n4.  **Google OAuth Flow**: The application initiates the standard Google OAuth process.\n    *   **States**: During this phase, a subtle loading indicator or message ('Redirecting to Google for sign-in...') may be displayed.\n5.  **Authentication Success**: Upon successful authentication with Google, the user is redirected back to the application.\n6.  **Display Dashboard**: The system then loads and displays the `DashboardScreen`.\n    *   **Elements**: A header ('Dashboard'), a personalized greeting ('Hello, [User Name]!'), a main content area placeholder, and a 'Logout' button.\n\n#### Scenario: Returning user / Authenticated User\n1.  **User Access**: User navigates to the application's base URL.\n2.  **Authentication Check**: The system detects a valid authentication token/session.\n3.  **Display Dashboard**: The system immediately loads and displays the `DashboardScreen`.\n\n### 2. UI States and Components\n\n*   **LoginScreen**:\n    *   **State**: Unauthenticated.\n    *   **Components**: Logo, Welcome Text, 'Sign in with Google' button.\n    *   **Copy**: \"Welcome to the Product\", \"Sign in with Google\".\n*   **Loading/Redirecting State (during OAuth)**:\n    *   **State**: Transient, during authentication.\n    *   **Components**: Optional subtle loading spinner or text.\n    *   **Copy**: \"Signing you in...\", \"Redirecting to Google...\".\n*   **DashboardScreen**:\n    *   **State**: Authenticated.\n    *   **Components**: Header (Dashboard), Greeting Text, Content Area (placeholder), Logout Button.\n    *   **Copy**: \"Dashboard\", \"Hello, [User Name]!\", \"Your content goes here...\", \"Logout\".\n\n### 3. Error Handling\n\n*   **Google Login Failure**: If the Google OAuth process fails (e.g., user cancels, network error, invalid credentials):\n    *   **Action**: User is redirected back to the `LoginScreen`.\n    *   **Feedback**: A non-intrusive, temporary error message is displayed (e.g., a toast notification) at the top or bottom of the screen.\n    *   **Copy**: \"Login failed. Please try again.\" or \"Authentication cancelled.\"\n*   **General Application Errors**: For any unhandled frontend errors, a generic error boundary or message should be considered for future iterations, but for this foundational step, focus is on login errors.",

  "validation_checklist": "## Validation Checklist: Foundational UI/UX (error-fix-1770414390219)\n\nBased on Design Agent's validation rules and current product beliefs:\n\n### 1. Can a new user predict what happens next?\n*   **Login Screen**: Is the 'Sign in with Google' button's purpose immediately clear? Does its placement and styling suggest it's the primary action?\n*   **Post-Login**: After clicking 'Sign in with Google' and completing the OAuth flow, is it obvious that the user will land on a dashboard or home screen?\n*   **Dashboard**: Are the elements on the dashboard (e.g., 'Logout' button) clearly indicating their function and next action?\n\n### 2. Is anything explained too late?\n*   **Initial Access**: Upon landing on the URL, is it immediately clear that authentication is required if the user is unauthenticated?\n*   **Login Feedback**: Are success/failure messages for the Google login process displayed promptly and clearly, without ambiguity?\n*   **Dashboard Clarity**: Is the purpose of the dashboard evident without requiring the user to explore or click around excessively?\n\n### 3. Does the UI match the intent?\n*   **Obvious without documentation**: Do the UI elements, labels, and overall flow feel intuitive and self-explanatory, aligning with the belief \"The product must feel obvious without documentation\"?\n*   **Speed over configurability**: Does the UI feel streamlined, minimal, and fast, particularly the login process and initial dashboard load, reflecting the belief \"Users value speed over configurability\"?\n*   **Technically competent user**: While simple, does the UI provide a clean, uncluttered foundation that a technically competent user would appreciate for its clarity and extensibility?\n*   **Modern Design System**: Does the visual design, component styling, and responsiveness align with the expectation of a 'modern design system' (shadcn/ui)?\n*   **Basic Dashboard**: Does the dashboard only contain essential, foundational elements, avoiding feature creep and complexity as intended for a 'basic' dashboard?",
  "summary": "The design intent for establishing the foundational UI/UX has been documented, emphasizing an obvious, fast, and visually consistent experience driven by Google login and a basic dashboard. A detailed design specification outlines the complete user flow, UI states, and essential copy, including basic error handling for login failures. Wireframe JSONs have been created for the Login and Dashboard screens, providing a structured representation for the Dev Agent. Finally, a validation checklist has been prepared to ensure the design aligns with product beliefs regarding predictability, timely explanations, and UI-to-intent matching, specifically focusing on the intuitiveness and speed of the core user journey."
