  "design_intent": "The intent behind this foundational UI development is to establish a modern, intuitive, and robust user interface for the product, leveraging React and shadcn/ui. The primary goal is to provide a seamless Google login experience and a clear, basic dashboard, embodying the core belief that 'A modern, intuitive UI is essential for initial user engagement and product viability.' This design aims to make the initial user experience feel obvious and frictionless, allowing users to predict interactions without documentation.",
  "design_spec": "The design specification covers two key screens: Login and Dashboard.1.  Login Screen:    Flow: User lands on the Login Screen.    Elements: App Title, Welcome message, 'Sign in with Google' button, Privacy Policy link.    States: Default (button enabled), Loading (button disabled during sign-in), Error (toast/message for failed login).    Copy: Clear calls to action for Google login.2.  Dashboard Screen:    Flow: Upon successful login, user is redirected to the Dashboard.    Elements: Dashboard header, personalized welcome message, a placeholder content card for future features, and a logout button.    States: Default (displays user info and content), Loading (for dynamic content).    Copy: Generic welcome, placeholder content.This foundational design prioritizes simplicity and directness, ensuring a clear path for new users from authentication to initial product interaction.",

  "validation_checklist": "Validation Checklist for Foundational UI:1.  Predictability for New Users:    Can a new user easily understand that clicking 'Sign in with Google' will initiate the login process?    Is the transition from login to dashboard clear and expected?    Does the dashboard clearly indicate it's the user's primary workspace?2.  Timeliness of Explanations:    Are there any critical pieces of information (e.g., login requirements, dashboard purpose) that are explained too late or not at all?    Is the 'Sign in with Google' button self-explanatory, or does it require additional context?3.  UI-Intent Match:    Does the clean, modern aesthetic (implied by shadcn/ui) align with the intent of a 'compelling and intuitive initial product experience'?    Does the simplicity of the login and dashboard screens support the belief that 'The product must feel obvious without documentation'?    Is the Google login prominently featured as the primary authentication method, matching the product decision?",
  "summary": "The Design Agent has created the foundational UI design for `error-fix-1770417770622`, encompassing a modern login screen with Google authentication and a basic dashboard. The design prioritizes clarity and intuitiveness, aligning with the product's belief in a compelling and obvious user experience. The wireframes provide a clear structural guide for development, and the validation checklist ensures the design meets core intent and user predictability criteria."
