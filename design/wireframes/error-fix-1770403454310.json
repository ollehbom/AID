  "design_intent": "This foundational feature establishes the core user interface for our application, addressing the critical need for a modern, consistent, and extensible UI platform. Its primary purpose is to enable rapid prototyping and validation of future user-centric features by providing a robust and familiar base. The design should feel obvious, fast, and professional, aligning with the core belief that our users are technically competent and value speed and clarity.",
  "design_spec": "# Design Specification: Foundational React Application (Login & Dashboard)\n\n## 1. Feature Overview\nThis specification details the design for the initial React application, encompassing the user login experience via Google OAuth, a basic dashboard, and the foundational integration of `shadcn/ui` as the design system. The goal is to create a minimal yet robust UI foundation for future development.\n\n## 2. User Flows\n\n### 2.1. Login Flow\n1.  **User arrives at application:** Displays the Login Screen.\n2.  **User clicks 'Sign in with Google':** Initiates Google OAuth process.\n3.  **Google OAuth completes:**\n    *   **Success:** User is redirected to the Dashboard Screen.\n    *   **Failure:** An error message (e.g., 'Google sign-in failed. Please try again.') is displayed on the Login Screen.\n\n### 2.2. Dashboard Flow\n1.  **Post-login or authenticated access:** User is presented with the Dashboard Screen.\n2.  **Basic content display:** Mock content is displayed to demonstrate basic layout and component usage.\n\n## 3. Screens\n\n### 3.1. Login Screen\n*   **Purpose:** Allow users to authenticate via Google OAuth.\n*   **Elements:**\n    *   App Logo/Name (e.g., 'Your App Name')\n    *   Welcome message (e.g., 'Welcome! Please sign in to continue.')\n    *   'Sign in with Google' button (primary action)\n*   **States:**\n    *   **Default:** Displays all elements.\n    *   **Loading:** Button may show a loading spinner, or the entire screen may have a subtle overlay.\n    *   **Error:** Displays an inline or toast error message (e.g., 'Authentication failed.').\n\n### 3.2. Dashboard Screen\n*   **Purpose:** Provide a basic landing page for authenticated users.\n*   **Elements:**\n    *   Header (e.g., 'Dashboard')\n    *   Placeholder content area (e.g., a simple card with 'Your content goes here.')\n    *   (Future consideration: User profile indicator/logout option, but not in initial MVP)\n*   **States:**\n    *   **Default:** Displays header and placeholder content.\n    *   **Loading:** (If dashboard content is dynamic) A skeleton loader for the content area.\n\n## 4. Design System Integration (`shadcn/ui`)\n*   **Purpose:** Ensure a consistent and modern look and feel across the application.\n*   **Guidelines:**\n    *   All UI components (buttons, text, containers) should leverage `shadcn/ui` components and styling utilities where applicable.\n    *   Establish a basic color palette (primary, accent, background, text) using `shadcn/ui`'s theming capabilities.\n    *   Define consistent typography (font families, sizes for headings, body text).\n    *   Ensure consistent spacing and layout practices.\n\n## 5. Copy\n*   **Login Screen:**\n    *   App Name: 'Your App Name'\n    *   Welcome Message: 'Welcome! Please sign in to continue.'\n    *   Button: 'Sign in with Google'\n    *   Error Message: 'Google sign-in failed. Please try again.'\n*   **Dashboard Screen:**\n    *   Header: 'Dashboard'\n    *   Placeholder Content: 'Your content goes here. This is your personal dashboard.'\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n*   **Google OAuth Failure:** Display a clear, concise error message on the Login Screen, prompting the user to retry.\n*   **General UI Errors:** (Out of scope for this foundational build, but future consideration for global error boundaries and logging.)",

  "validation_checklist": "- **Can a new user predict what happens next?** Yes, the 'Sign in with Google' button clearly indicates the action. Upon successful login, landing on a 'Dashboard' implies a central hub for activity.\n- **Is anything explained too late?** No, the login prompt is immediate and direct. The dashboard, being minimal, requires little explanation, aligning with the 'obvious without documentation' belief.\n- **Does the UI match the intent?** Yes. The simple login screen and basic dashboard, built on a modern design system like shadcn/ui, directly supports the intent of an 'obvious, fast, and professional' foundational UI for technically competent users, enabling 'rapid prototyping and validation'.",
  "summary": "The design for the foundational React application focuses on a minimalist login experience via Google OAuth and a basic dashboard, both leveraging shadcn/ui for a modern, consistent aesthetic. The intent is to provide a clear, fast, and extensible UI base, validated against core beliefs of user predictability and UI-intent alignment. The wireframe for the login screen provides a direct call to action, ensuring new users can easily understand the next step."
