  "design_intent": "The primary intent is to establish a robust, aesthetically consistent, and intuitively navigable core application foundation. By leveraging `shadcn/ui`, we aim to provide a rapid development environment for future features while ensuring the initial user experience is 'obvious without documentation' and 'fast over configurability,' aligning with core product beliefs. This foundational design focuses on a frictionless Google login and a clear, welcoming dashboard, setting a professional tone for technically competent users.",
  "design_spec": "# Design Specification: Core React Application Foundation (gh-vs-5)This document details the design specification for establishing the core React application foundation using `shadcn/ui`, including Google login, a basic dashboard, and an initial design system.## 1. User Flow: Google Login & Dashboard Access1.  **Entry Point**: User accesses the application URL.2.  **Login Screen Display**: The application presents a minimalist login screen.    *   **Elements**: A prominent 'Welcome' header, a brief instruction ('Please sign in to continue.'), and a distinct 'Sign in with Google' button.3.  **Authentication Initiation**: User clicks 'Sign in with Google'.    *   **State Change**: Button may show a loading spinner or become disabled to indicate processing.4.  **Google Authentication**: User is redirected to Google's authentication flow (handled by Google).5.  **Dashboard Access**: Upon successful authentication, the user is seamlessly redirected to the application's dashboard.    *   **State Change**: Dashboard loads with a 'Welcome, [User Name]!' message and a placeholder for core content.## 2. Key UI Elements & States### Login Screen-   **Initial State**:    *   `Header`: 'Welcome' (H1, centered, prominent).    *   `Sub-header`: 'Please sign in to continue.' (P, centered, explanatory).    *   `Button`: 'Sign in with Google' (Primary button style, centered, clearly actionable).-   **Loading State (during Google redirect)**:    *   `Button`: Disabled, potentially with a subtle spinner or 'Signing in...' text.### Dashboard Screen-   **Initial State**:    *   `Header`: 'Dashboard' (H1, prominent).    *   `Greeting`: 'Welcome, [User Name]!' (P, personalized).    *   `Content Area`: A simple placeholder card or text indicating 'This is your dashboard. More features coming soon!' to establish the basic layout.## 3. Copy-   **Login Screen**:    *   Header: 'Welcome'-   Prompt: 'Please sign in to continue.'-   Button: 'Sign in with Google'-   **Dashboard Screen**:    *   Header: 'Dashboard'-   Greeting: 'Welcome, [User Name]!'-   Placeholder: 'This is your dashboard. Start exploring!'## 4. Error Handling-   **Authentication Failure**: If Google authentication fails or is cancelled:-   User is redirected back to the Login Screen.-   A temporary, non-intrusive alert/toast message appears: 'Authentication failed. Please try again.' or 'Login cancelled. Please try again.'-   The 'Sign in with Google' button becomes re-enabled.## 5. Design System Integration-   All UI elements (typography, buttons, spacing, colors) will adhere to `shadcn/ui`'s default theme and component styling to ensure consistency and a professional appearance from day one.",

  "validation_checklist": "1.  **Predictability for New Users**:\n    *   Is the purpose of the login screen immediately clear to a new user? (Yes, 'Welcome' and 'Sign in to continue').\n    *   Is the action of clicking 'Sign in with Google' clearly predictive of initiating a Google authentication flow? (Yes, explicit label).\n    *   Is the expected outcome after successful login (dashboard) clear or implicitly understood? (Implicit, but the flow is standard).\n2.  **Timeliness of Explanations**:\n    *   Are error messages for failed authentication displayed immediately and clearly on the login screen? (Yes, as specified).\n    *   Are instructions for login present before an action is required? (Yes, 'Please sign in to continue.').\n3.  **UI-Intent Match**:\n    *   Does the minimalist and clean UI (implied by `shadcn/ui` foundation) align with the intent of 'obvious without documentation' and 'speed over configurability'? (Yes, reduces cognitive load).\n    *   Does the 'Sign in with Google' button feel prominent and trustworthy, reflecting the importance of this initial step? (Yes, primary button).\n    *   Is the transition from login to dashboard seamless, reflecting a 'fast' and 'frictionless' experience? (Yes, direct redirect).\n    *   Does the initial dashboard present a clear, non-overwhelming starting point for a 'technically competent' user? (Yes, basic greeting and placeholder).",
  "summary": "The design for the core application foundation (gh-vs-5) focuses on a clean, intuitive Google login experience and a basic dashboard, leveraging `shadcn/ui` for consistency. The design intent prioritizes speed, clarity, and adherence to core product beliefs, ensuring a frictionless entry for technically competent users. The wireframe provides a simple login screen, and the spec details the flow, states, and error handling for a robust initial build."
