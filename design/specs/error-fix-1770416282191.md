# Design Specification: Establish Foundational UI and Design System

## 1. Overview
This specification details the initial user interface for the application, focusing on establishing a robust React front-end with `shadcn/ui`, a Google login flow, and a basic dashboard. The primary goal is to create an "obvious" and consistent user experience, aligning with the core belief that "the product must feel obvious without documentation."

## 2. User Flow: Google Login & Dashboard Access

### 2.1. Initial Application Load
*   **User Action**: User navigates to the application URL.
*   **System Response**: The application loads and presents the "Login Screen."

### 2.2. Login Screen Interaction
*   **User Action**: User clicks "Sign in with Google."
*   **System Response**: 
    *   A loading indicator appears on the button or centrally.
    *   A new browser window/tab or a pop-up opens for Google authentication.
    *   User completes Google's authentication process.
*   **System Response (Success)**:
    *   Google authentication succeeds.
    *   The pop-up/new tab closes.
    *   The application redirects to the "Dashboard Screen."
*   **System Response (Failure)**:
    *   Google authentication fails (e.g., user cancels, network error, Google error).
    *   The pop-up/new tab closes.
    *   An error message is displayed on the "Login Screen."

### 2.3. Dashboard Screen
*   **User Action**: (Implicit) User lands on the Dashboard after successful login.
*   **System Response**: 
    *   Displays a welcome message and placeholder content.
    *   (Future) Displays core application features.

## 3. States and Copy

### 3.1. Login Screen

*   **Initial State**:
    *   **Layout**: Centered card or panel.
    *   **Header**: "Welcome to [App Name]"
    *   **Body**: "Please sign in to continue."
    *   **Button**: "Sign in with Google" (with Google icon)
    *   **Microcopy**: None initially.

*   **Loading State (during Google auth)**:
    *   **Layout**: Same as initial.
    *   **Button**: "Signing in..." (button disabled, spinner/loading indicator within button or nearby).
    *   **Microcopy**: "Redirecting to Google for authentication..." (optional, subtle text below button).

*   **Error State (Google auth failed)**:
    *   **Layout**: Same as initial.
    *   **Button**: "Sign in with Google" (enabled).
    *   **Error Message**: "Authentication failed. Please try again." (prominent, e.g., red text below header or above button).
    *   **Edge Case Error**: "Could not connect to Google. Please check your internet connection." (for network-related failures).

### 3.2. Dashboard Screen

*   **Loading State (initial dashboard data)**:
    *   **Layout**: Main content area shows a skeleton loader or a central spinner.
    *   **Header**: "Dashboard"
    *   **Microcopy**: "Loading your data..." (subtle).

*   **Empty State (no data yet)**:
    *   **Layout**: Main content area.
    *   **Header**: "Dashboard"
    *   **Welcome Message**: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
    *   **Body**: "It looks like you don't have any data yet. Start by [Call to Action, e.g., 'creating your first project']." (Placeholder for future feature).

*   **Content Display State**:
    *   **Layout**: Main content area displays relevant information.
    *   **Header**: "Dashboard"
    *   **Welcome Message**: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
    *   **Content**: Placeholder for core metrics, recent activity, etc. (e.g., "Your recent activity will appear here.").

*   **Error State (dashboard data fetch failed)**:
    *   **Layout**: Main content area.
    *   **Header**: "Dashboard"
    *   **Error Message**: "Could not load dashboard data. Please refresh or contact support if the issue persists." (Prominent, with a "Refresh" button).

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases
*   **Google Authentication Network Issues**: If the user's internet connection drops during Google auth, the Google pop-up will typically handle this, but if the callback fails, the application should display the generic "Authentication failed. Please try again." message.
*   **Invalid/Expired Session**: If a user tries to access a protected route without a valid session, they should be redirected to the Login Screen.
*   **Dashboard Data Fetch Failures**: Implement robust error boundaries and display user-friendly messages with options to retry or report.

## 5. Transitions and Animations
*   **Login Button**: Subtle hover state, click animation (e.g., slight press down).
*   **Page Transitions**: Standard browser navigation, no elaborate custom transitions for this initial phase.
*   **Loading Indicators**: Spinners for buttons during actions, skeleton loaders for content areas during data fetches.
*   **Error Messages**: Appear smoothly (e.g., fade in) to draw attention.

## 6. Accessibility Considerations
*   Ensure all interactive elements (buttons) are keyboard navigable.
*   Provide appropriate ARIA labels for loading states and error messages.
*   Maintain sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements (as provided by shadcn/ui defaults).

## 7. Design System Integration
*   All UI components (buttons, input fields - if any future login options, cards, typography) will leverage `shadcn/ui` components to ensure consistency and ease of development.
