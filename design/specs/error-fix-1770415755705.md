# Design Specification: Initial UI Foundation (`error-fix-1770415755705`)

## 1. Feature Overview
This specification details the design for the foundational UI elements: a login screen with Google authentication and a basic dashboard. The goal is to establish a clear, consistent, and intuitive user experience from the outset, adhering to Shadcn UI principles and supporting rapid future development. This aligns directly with the core belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation."

## 2. User Flow

### 2.1. Initial Access & Login Flow
**User Goal**: Access the product and view the dashboard for the first time.

1.  **System State**: User navigates to the application URL (e.g., `app.example.com`).
2.  **UI Display**: Login Screen (Initial State).
    *   **User Action**: Clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
3.  **System State**: Initiates Google OAuth flow; browser redirects to Google's authentication page.
4.  **User Action**: Authenticates with Google (selects account, grants permissions).
5.  **System State**: Google redirects back to the application with an authentication token.
6.  **UI Display**: Login Screen (Loading State: "Signing in...").
7.  **System State**: Application processes token, establishes user session, fetches initial dashboard data.
8.  **UI Display**: Dashboard Screen (Content Display State).

### 2.2. Subsequent Access (Authenticated)
**User Goal**: Access the product after a successful login (session active).

1.  **System State**: User navigates to the application URL.
2.  **UI Display**: Briefly displays Dashboard (Loading State).
3.  **System State**: Application checks for an active session/token and fetches dashboard data.
4.  **UI Display**: Dashboard Screen (Content Display State).

## 3. States

### 3.1. Login Screen States

#### 3.1.1. Initial State
*   **Description**: The primary entry point for unauthenticated users.
*   **UI Elements**: Centered layout.
    *   **Header**: "Welcome"
    *   **Subheader**: "Sign in to continue."
    *   **Button**: "Sign in with Google" (prominent)
*   **Copy**:
    *   Header: "Welcome"
    *   Subheader: "Sign in to continue."
    *   Button: "Sign in with Google"

#### 3.1.2. Loading State (Authentication in Progress)
*   **Description**: Shown after clicking "Sign in with Google" and during redirect/token processing.
*   **UI Elements**:
    *   **Spinner/Loader**: Centered, indicating activity.
    *   **Text**: Below spinner.
*   **Copy**: "Signing in..."

#### 3.1.3. Error State (Authentication Failed)
*   **Description**: If Google authentication fails (e.g., user denies access, network error).
*   **UI Elements**:
    *   **Login Screen**: Reverts to Initial State.
    *   **Error Message**: Temporary toast/banner at the top/bottom of the screen.
*   **Copy**:
    *   Error Message: "Something went wrong. Please try again."

### 3.2. Dashboard Screen States

#### 3.2.1. Loading State (Initial Data Fetch)
*   **Description**: Shown upon successful login while initial dashboard content is being fetched.
*   **UI Elements**:
    *   **Skeleton Loaders**: Mimicking the layout of the dashboard content (e.g., for header, cards).
    *   **Optional Text**: Below skeleton.
*   **Copy**: "Loading your dashboard..."

#### 3.2.2. Content Display State
*   **Description**: The main view for authenticated users, displaying mock content.
*   **UI Elements**:
    *   **Header**: "Dashboard"
    *   **Navigation**: (Placeholder for future, e.g., "Home", "Settings", "Log Out").
    *   **Main Content Area**: Grid or stacked cards.
        *   **Card 1**: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
        *   **Card 2**: "Quick Actions" (e.g., Button: "Create Project", Button: "View Reports").
        *   **Card 3**: "Recent Activity" (e.g., Text: "No recent activity.").
*   **Copy**:
    *   Header: "Dashboard"
    *   Card 1: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
    *   Card 2 Title: "Quick Actions"
    *   Card 2 Items: "Create Project", "View Reports"
    *   Card 3 Title: "Recent Activity"
    *   Card 3 Empty State: "No recent activity."

#### 3.2.3. Error State (Dashboard Data Fetch Failed)
*   **Description**: If there's an issue fetching dashboard-specific data after successful authentication.
*   **UI Elements**:
    *   **Dashboard Layout**: Remains, but main content area displays an error message.
    *   **Error Message**: Prominent, within the main content area.
    *   **Button**: "Retry"
*   **Copy**:
    *   Error Message: "Failed to load dashboard. Please try again."
    *   Button: "Retry"

## 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases
*   **Google Auth Denied**: If a user denies access, they are redirected to the Login Screen (Initial State) without an explicit error message (as it's a user action).
*   **Network Offline**: Leads to relevant Error States (Login or Dashboard Data Fetch).
*   **Session Expiration**: Not explicitly handled in this MVP; future implementation will redirect to login with an appropriate message.
*   **No User Data**: If backend fails to provide user details or dashboard content, the Dashboard Data Fetch Error State is triggered.

## 5. Transitions & Animations
*   **Loading States**: Utilize Shadcn's default spinner or skeleton components for smooth visual feedback.
*   **Error Messages**: Appear briefly (e.g., 3-5 seconds) and fade out, or require manual dismissal for critical errors.
*   **Navigation**: Simple, immediate transitions between screens (e.g., direct redirect, no complex page transitions).

## 6. Design System Guidelines (Implicit via Shadcn UI)
*   **Components**: Leverage Shadcn UI components (Button, Card, Spinner, Toast) for consistency, accessibility, and rapid development.
*   **Styling**: Adhere to Shadcn's default typography, color palette, and spacing scale for a cohesive look and feel.
*   **Responsiveness**: Basic responsiveness should be considered, ensuring usability on mobile and desktop viewports through fluid layouts and component adaptations.

## 7. Validation against Beliefs
This design directly supports the core belief: "The product must feel obvious without documentation."
*   **Login Screen**: Clear "Sign in with Google" button with minimal distractions makes the primary action self-evident.
*   **Dashboard**: A simple, card-based layout with clear headings ("Dashboard", "Welcome") and explicit actions ("Create Project", "View Reports") ensures users can immediately understand the purpose and navigate without guidance.
*   **Loading & Error States**: Provide immediate, understandable feedback, preventing user confusion and reducing the need for external documentation when things don't go as expected.
*   **Shadcn UI**: The use of a well-established UI library provides familiar interaction patterns and visual cues, contributing to an intuitive experience.
