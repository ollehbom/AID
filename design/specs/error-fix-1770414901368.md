# Design Specification: Core Application Foundation (Login & Dashboard)## Feature ID: error-fix-1770414901368### 1. Design Intent SummaryTo establish a clear, intuitive, and consistent foundational user interface for the AI Pipeline application, prioritizing speed of interaction and development. This includes a streamlined login experience via Google OAuth and a simple dashboard.### 2. User Flow#### A. Initial Application Access & Login1.  **User Action**: User navigates to the application URL.2.  **System Response**:    *   If not authenticated: User is redirected to the Login Screen.    *   If authenticated: User is redirected to the Dashboard.3.  **Login Screen Interaction**:    *   User sees "Welcome to [App Name]" and a "Sign in with Google" button.    *   **User Action**: Clicks "Sign in with Google".    *   **System Response**: Initiates Google OAuth flow (opens popup/redirects).    *   **User Action**: Completes Google authentication.    *   **System Response**:        *   **Success**: User is redirected to the Dashboard.        *   **Failure**: User remains on Login Screen, an error message is displayed.#### B. Dashboard Access (Post-Login)1.  **System Response**: Upon successful login, the user is presented with the Dashboard.2.  **Dashboard Content**: Displays a welcome message and mock content.### 3. All Possible States#### A. Login Screen*   **Initial State** (Pre-authentication):    *   **UI**: Centered layout with application logo/name, "Welcome to AI Pipeline" heading, and a prominent "Sign in with Google" button.    *   **Copy**:        *   Heading: "Welcome to AI Pipeline"        *   Button: "Sign in with Google"*   **Loading State** (during OAuth initiation/completion):    *   **UI**: "Sign in with Google" button may change to a loading spinner or "Connecting..." text, or a full-screen overlay with a spinner.    *   **Copy**: "Connecting..." (if button text changes) or "Please wait..."*   **Error State** (OAuth Failure):    *   **UI**: Display a clear, non-intrusive error message below the heading or above the button.    *   **Copy**: "Login failed. Please try again." (Error message should be dismissible or automatically fade after a few seconds).#### B. Dashboard Screen*   **Initial State** (Post-authentication, content loaded):    *   **UI**: Simple header with "Dashboard", a "Welcome, [User Name]!" message, and a placeholder content area (e.g., a Shadcn Card component).    *   **Copy**:        *   Header: "Dashboard"        *   Greeting: "Welcome, [User Name]!" (dynamically populated)        *   Content Area Title: "Your Overview"        *   Placeholder Text: "This is your central hub for managing AI Pipeline experiments and data. More features coming soon!"*   **Loading State** (if dashboard data is fetched upon entry):    *   **UI**: Content area displays a skeleton loader or a spinner.    *   **Copy**: "Getting things ready..."*   **Error State** (if dashboard data fails to load):    *   **UI**: Content area displays an error message in place of content.    *   **Copy**: "Failed to load dashboard data. Please refresh or contact support."### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases*   **Google OAuth Failure**:    *   **Mechanism**: If the Google OAuth process fails (e.g., user cancels, network error during authentication, invalid credentials), the user is returned to the login screen.    *   **Feedback**: A temporary error message ("Login failed. Please try again.") is displayed.    *   **Retry**: The "Sign in with Google" button remains active, allowing the user to retry. No lockout mechanisms are needed for this foundational phase.*   **Network Issues (General)**:    *   **Mechanism**: For any network request failure (e.g., during initial app load, dashboard data fetch), a generic "Network error. Please check your connection and try again." message should be displayed.    *   **Placement**: For login, on the login screen. For dashboard, within the content area.*   **Unauthorized Access**:    *   **Mechanism**: If a user tries to access a protected route without a valid session, they are automatically redirected to the Login Screen. No explicit error message is needed beyond the login screen's presence, as the login screen itself implies the need for authentication.### 5. Transitions and Animations*   **Loading Indicators**: Use subtle spinners or skeleton loaders (Shadcn UI provides these) for any data fetching or authentication processes that take more than ~300ms. Emphasis on perceived speed.*   **Page Transitions**: Standard browser page transitions on redirect. No custom, elaborate animations are required for this foundational phase, keeping the experience lean and fast.*   **Error Messages**: Should appear and disappear gracefully (e.g., a subtle fade-in/fade-out or slide-in from top/bottom) without obscuring critical UI elements.
