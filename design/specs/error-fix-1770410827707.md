# Design Specification: error-fix-1770410827707 - Foundational UI

## 1. User Flow

**Objective**: Allow new and returning users to sign in via Google and access a basic dashboard.

**Flow:**

1.  **Initial Access / Unauthenticated State:**
    *   User navigates to the application URL.
    *   System checks for an active session. If none, user is directed to the Login Screen.
2.  **Login Screen:**
    *   Displays a clear call to action for signing in.
    *   User clicks "Sign in with Google".
3.  **Google Authentication (External):**
    *   User is redirected to Google's authentication flow.
    *   User selects/enters their Google account credentials.
4.  **Authentication Processing:**
    *   After successful Google authentication, the system processes the user's credentials.
    *   A loading indicator is displayed during this brief period.
5.  **Dashboard Access / Authenticated State:**
    *   Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the Dashboard.
    *   If a session already exists (step 1), the user is directly taken to the Dashboard.

## 2. All Possible States & Copy

### A. Unauthenticated State (Login Screen)
*   **State**: Initial view for users without an active session.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Header**: "Welcome to [Product Name]"
    *   **Call to Action**: "Sign in with Google" (as a button label)
    *   **Subtext (optional, minimal)**: "Your journey starts here."

### B. Authentication Loading State
*   **State**: Immediately after clicking "Sign in with Google" and before redirection to the dashboard.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Indicator**: Spinning loader or progress bar.
    *   **Text**: "Connecting to Google...", "Signing you in..."

### C. Authentication Error State
*   **State**: If Google authentication fails (e.g., user cancels, network error, invalid credentials) or our system fails to process the Google response.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Error Message**: "Login failed. Please try again."
    *   **Optional Detail**: "If the problem persists, please contact support."
    *   **Action**: "Try Again" button, which restarts the Google login flow.

### D. Authenticated State (Dashboard)
*   **State**: User successfully logged in and viewing the primary dashboard.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Header**: "Welcome, [User Name]!" (e.g., "Welcome, Alex!")
    *   **Section Title**: "Your Dashboard"
    *   **Placeholder Content (Initial/Empty State)**: "No data available yet. Start by exploring features or connecting your first project."
    *   **Action (for empty state)**: "Get Started" button (or similar, depending on first actions).

### E. Dashboard Data Loading State
*   **State**: When the dashboard itself is loading initial data after successful login.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Indicator**: Spinning loader within the dashboard content area.
    *   **Text**: "Loading your dashboard..."

### F. Dashboard Data Error State
*   **State**: If dashboard data fails to load after successful login (e.g., API error).
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Error Message**: "Failed to load dashboard data. Please try again."
    *   **Action**: "Retry" button.

## 3. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Auth Failure**: Display a clear, actionable error message on the login screen, allowing the user to retry.
*   **Backend Auth Failure**: Similar to Google Auth Failure, present a user-friendly error message.
*   **Network Issues**: Implement basic network error handling (e.g., graceful failure messages) during API calls for login and dashboard data.
*   **Session Expiry**: If a session expires while on the dashboard, the user should be redirected to the login screen with a message like "Your session has expired. Please sign in again." (This can be a future enhancement if not critical for MVP).
*   **No Dashboard Data**: Display the empty state message and a clear call to action.

## 4. Transitions and Animations

*   **Loading Indicators**: Use subtle spinners or progress bars for any loading states (e.g., after clicking "Sign in with Google", during dashboard data fetch).
*   **Page Transitions**: Standard, fast page transitions (e.g., instant redirect) between login and dashboard. No elaborate animations are required for this foundational build.
*   **UI Elements**: All UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards) should reflect the `shadcn` design system for consistent appearance and interaction.
