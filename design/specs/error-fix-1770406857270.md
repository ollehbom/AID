## Design Specification: Foundational UI/UX (Google Login & Basic Dashboard)

This specification details the user flow, states, copy, and error handling for the initial Google Login screen and the subsequent basic Dashboard page, leveraging `shadcn/ui` for a consistent and modern aesthetic.

### 1. User Flow: Google Login & Dashboard Access

1.  **Initial Access**: User navigates to the application URL.
2.  **Login Screen Presentation**: The Google Login screen is displayed.
3.  **Initiate Login**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
4.  **Google OAuth Redirection**: User is redirected to Google's authentication page (handled by Google).
5.  **Authentication & Authorization**: User logs into their Google account and grants necessary permissions.
6.  **Callback & Token Exchange**: Google redirects back to the application with an authorization code/token.
7.  **User Session Establishment**: The application processes the token, establishes a user session.
8.  **Dashboard Redirection**: User is redirected to the main Dashboard page.
9.  **Dashboard Presentation**: The Dashboard page is displayed with initial content.

### 2. States and Copy

#### A. Login Screen

**1. Default State**
*   **Layout**: Centered content on a clean, minimal background. A prominent branding element (e.g., logo) at the top.
*   **Title**: "Welcome to [Product Name]"
*   **Body Text (Optional, below title)**: "Sign in to continue to your dashboard."
*   **Action Button**: "Sign in with Google" (Prominent `shadcn/ui` Button component, styled for primary action).
*   **Footer (Optional)**: "By signing in, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy."

**2. Loading State (During Google OAuth)**
*   **Layout**: Same as default, but with a visual indicator.
*   **Action Button**: "Signing in..." (Button disabled, includes a small spinner/loading indicator).
*   **Visual**: A subtle, full-screen overlay or a spinner near the button to indicate ongoing process.

**3. Error State (Login Failed)**
*   **Layout**: Default state with an error message.
*   **Error Message**: Displayed prominently near the top or above the button.
    *   **Copy**: "Login failed. Please try again. If the issue persists, contact support." (Red text, `shadcn/ui` Alert component).
*   **Action Button**: "Sign in with Google" (Enabled).

#### B. Dashboard Page

**1. Default State (Post-Login)**
*   **Layout**: Standard header (e.g., product name/logo, user avatar/menu), main content area.
*   **Header Title**: "Dashboard"
*   **Welcome Message**: "Welcome, [User Name]!" (e.g., "Welcome, John Doe!")
*   **Placeholder Content**: A `shadcn/ui` Card component with a title "Your Overview" and placeholder text "This is your personalized dashboard. More features coming soon!" or a simple list of mock items.
*   **User Menu (in header)**: User's profile picture/initials. Clicking it reveals a dropdown with "Settings", "Sign Out".

**2. Loading State (Initial Data Fetch on Dashboard)**
*   **Layout**: Header visible. Main content area shows a skeleton loader or a central spinner.
*   **Visual**: `shadcn/ui` Skeleton components for content cards or a central `shadcn/ui` Spinner.
*   **Copy**: No specific copy, visual loading only.

**3. Error State (Dashboard Data Fetch Failed)**
*   **Layout**: Header visible. Main content area displays an error message.
*   **Error Message**: Displayed prominently in the main content area.
    *   **Copy**: "Unable to load dashboard content. Please refresh the page or contact support." (Red text, `shadcn/ui` Alert component).
*   **Action**: A "Refresh" button (`shadcn/ui` Button) may be included next to the error message.

**4. Empty State (If applicable, e.g., no projects)**
*   **Layout**: Header visible. Main content area displays an encouraging message.
*   **Title**: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
*   **Body**: "It looks like you don't have any [items] yet. Let's get started!"
*   **Action Button**: "Create your first [item]" (`shadcn/ui` Button).

### 3. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google OAuth Failure**: If Google authentication fails (e.g., user cancels, network issue during redirect, invalid credentials on Google's side), the user should be redirected back to the application's login screen with the "Login failed" error message.
*   **Network Issues**: During any API call (login token exchange, dashboard data fetch), if a network error occurs, appropriate error messages should be displayed on the respective screens (Login Error, Dashboard Data Fetch Error).
*   **Unauthorized Access**: If a user tries to access a protected route (e.g., `/dashboard`) without a valid session, they should be redirected to the Login Screen.
*   **Session Expiration**: If a user's session expires while on the dashboard, subsequent protected API calls should trigger a redirect back to the Login Screen, potentially with a message like "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."

### 4. Transitions and Animations

*   **Loading Indicators**: Use subtle `shadcn/ui` loading spinners or skeleton loaders during data fetching or authentication processes to provide visual feedback and prevent perceived latency.
*   **Page Transitions**: Standard, fast page transitions upon successful login/redirection. No complex animations are required at this foundational stage to maintain speed and simplicity.
