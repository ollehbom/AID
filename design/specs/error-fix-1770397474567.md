# Design Specification: Core Application Foundation (Login & Dashboard)

## 1. User Flow

### 1.1 Initial Access & Login
1.  **User navigates to application URL:** User opens the web application in their browser.
2.  **System checks authentication status:**
    *   If authenticated, user is redirected directly to the Dashboard.
    *   If not authenticated, user is presented with the Login Page.
3.  **Login Page Interaction:**
    *   User sees a clear "Welcome" message and a prominent "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   User clicks "Sign in with Google".
4.  **Google Authentication Flow:**
    *   Application initiates Google OAuth process (redirect to Google, user selects account, grants permissions if needed).
    *   Upon successful authentication, Google redirects back to the application.
5.  **Application Authentication & Redirection:**
    *   Application processes the Google authentication token.
    *   Upon successful processing, user is redirected to the Dashboard Page.

### 1.2 Dashboard Access
1.  **Dashboard Page Load:** After successful login, the Dashboard page loads.
2.  **Content Display:** The dashboard displays a personalized welcome message and placeholder content (e.g., "Quick Actions" card, "Recent Activity" card).

## 2. All Possible States

### 2.1 Login Page States
*   **Initial State:** Displays "Welcome!" header, "Sign in with Google" button, and optional microcopy for support.
*   **Loading State (during Google OAuth):** A subtle loading indicator (e.g., spinner) can be shown briefly on the login page or within the button itself, or the page might simply redirect without a distinct loading state shown to the user on the app's side. For simplicity, we assume a redirect, but an in-button spinner is a good fallback for visual feedback before redirect.
*   **Error State (Google Login Failed):** Displays the initial state with an additional, prominent error message.

### 2.2 Dashboard Page States
*   **Initial State (Loaded):** Displays header "Welcome, [User Name]!", "Your Dashboard" title, and various content cards.
*   **Loading State (Dashboard Content):** If dashboard content requires asynchronous fetching, a skeleton loader or a spinner should be displayed within the content areas until data is ready. For this MVP, assume static content initially, so a distinct loading state might not be visible to the user beyond initial page render.
*   **Empty State:** Not applicable for this initial basic dashboard, as it will always display static placeholder content.
*   **Error State (Dashboard Content Load Failed):** If dynamic content were to be introduced later and fail, an error message would appear in place of affected content. For MVP, assume static content, so this state is less critical unless the entire page fails.

## 3. Exact Copy/Microcopy

### 3.1 Login Page
*   **Main Header:** "Welcome to [App Name]!" (Replace `[App Name]` with actual app name)
*   **Button Text:** "Sign in with Google"
*   **Error Message (Google Login Failed):** "Sign in failed. Please try again or contact support if the problem persists."
*   **Support Link (optional):** "Contact Support"

### 3.2 Dashboard Page
*   **Top Header:** "Welcome, [User Name]!"
*   **Page Title:** "Your Dashboard"
*   **Card Title (Example 1):** "Quick Actions"
*   **Card Content (Example 1):** "Start New Project", "View Reports", "Manage Team" (placeholder buttons/links)
*   **Card Title (Example 2):** "Recent Activity"
*   **Card Content (Example 2):** "No recent activity." or list items.

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Authentication Failure:**
    *   If Google OAuth fails (e.g., user denies permissions, network error during Google redirect), the user is returned to the Login Page with an error message displayed prominently (see 3.1 Error Message).
    *   The error message should be dismissible or disappear after a short timeout.
*   **Network Issues:** If the application cannot connect to the backend during initial load or login, a generic network error message should be displayed, advising the user to check their connection and refresh. This is typically handled by the browser or framework.
*   **Session Expiration:** (Future consideration, not for MVP) If a user's session expires while on the dashboard, they should be redirected to the Login Page.

## 5. Transitions and Animations

*   **Page Load:** Standard browser page load/render.
*   **Button Interaction:** Subtle hover and active states for the "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Loading Indicators:** If a distinct loading state is needed before redirect, a small, unobtrusive spinner within the "Sign in with Google" button or centrally on the page.
*   **Error Message:** Fade-in/fade-out animation for error messages for better visibility.
