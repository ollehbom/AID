# Design Specification: Initial UI Foundation (error-fix-1770406372044)

## 1. Complete User Flow

**A. Initial Access / Login Flow**
1.  **User navigates to application URL:** The application's web interface loads.
2.  **Display Login Page:** The user is presented with the primary login screen.
3.  **User Clicks "Sign in with Google":** User initiates the Google authentication process.
4.  **Redirect to Google for Authentication:** The user's browser is redirected to Google's authentication page.
5.  **User Authenticates with Google:** User completes the Google login flow (e.g., selects account, enters password, grants permissions).
6.  **Redirect back to Application:** Upon successful Google authentication, the user's browser is redirected back to the application with authentication tokens.
7.  **Display Loading State:** The application shows a temporary loading indicator while processing the authentication and preparing the dashboard.
8.  **Display Dashboard:** User is successfully logged in, and the basic dashboard is rendered.

**B. Dashboard Access Flow (Post-Login)**
1.  **User navigates to application URL (already logged in):** The application loads.
2.  **Verify Session:** Application checks for an active user session.
3.  **Display Loading State:** If session is valid, a brief loading indicator appears while dashboard data is fetched.
4.  **Display Dashboard:** The user's dashboard is rendered directly.

## 2. All Possible States

### 2.1 Login Page
*   **State:** Initial, awaiting user interaction.
*   **Elements:** Title, Subtitle, "Sign in with Google" button, (Optional) footer text.

### 2.2 Loading State (Post-Login / Dashboard Load)
*   **State:** Temporarily displayed while authentication is confirmed or dashboard data is fetched.
*   **Elements:** Central loading spinner/indicator.

### 2.3 Dashboard Page
*   **State:** User successfully logged in, core application content displayed.
*   **Elements:** Header (e.g., "Dashboard"), Welcome message (e.g., "Welcome, [User Name]!"), Placeholder content card.

### 2.4 Error State (Login Failure)
*   **State:** Google authentication fails or there's a network issue during login.
*   **Elements:** Error title, descriptive error message, "Try Again" button.

### 2.5 Error State (Dashboard Load Failure)
*   **State:** Application fails to fetch or render dashboard content after successful login.
*   **Elements:** Error title, descriptive error message, "Refresh" button.

## 3. Exact Copy/Microcopy

### 3.1 Login Page
*   **Title:** "Welcome to [Product Name]"
*   **Subtitle:** "Your journey begins here."
*   **"Sign in with Google" Button:** "Sign in with Google"
*   **(Optional) Footer Text:** "By signing in, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy."

### 3.2 Loading State
*   **Text (centered):** "Just a moment..." or "Securing your connection..."

### 3.3 Dashboard Page
*   **Page Title:** "Dashboard"
*   **Welcome Message:** "Welcome, [User Name]!"
*   **Placeholder Content Card Title:** "Your Central Hub"
*   **Placeholder Content Card Body:** "This is your central hub. More features coming soon! We're building something great for you."

### 3.4 Error State (Login Failure)
*   **Error Title:** "Login Failed"
*   **Error Message:** "Could not sign you in with Google. Please try again or contact support if the issue persists."
*   **Button:** "Try Again"

### 3.5 Error State (Dashboard Load Failure)
*   **Error Title:** "Failed to Load Dashboard"
*   **Error Message:** "We're having trouble loading your data. Please refresh the page or try again later."
*   **Button:** "Refresh"

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Authentication Failure:** If the user cancels the Google login, Google returns an error, or the network connection drops during authentication, the application will redirect back to the `Login Failed` state. The user can then `Try Again`.
*   **Network Interruption:** If network connectivity is lost during any data fetch (e.g., post-login user data, dashboard content), the appropriate `Error State` (`Login Failure` or `Dashboard Load Failure`) will be displayed.
*   **Invalid/Expired Token:** If the application receives an invalid or expired authentication token from Google, it should gracefully fall back to the `Login Failure` state and prompt the user to sign in again.
*   **User Not Provisioned:** (Future consideration, but for MVP assume Google auth success = app login success). If a user successfully authenticates with Google but is not recognized by the application's backend, a specific error message should be displayed (e.g., "Account not found. Please contact support.") and prevent access to the dashboard.

## 5. Transitions and Animations

*   **Loading Spinner:** A subtle, centrally located loading spinner will be displayed during the `Loading State` to indicate ongoing processes.
*   **Page Transitions:** Simple fade-in/out or slide transitions for page changes (e.g., login to dashboard, error to login) to provide a smooth, modern feel without introducing unnecessary delays.
*   **Button Interaction:** Subtle hover and click feedback (e.g., slight background color change, shadow) for the "Sign in with Google" button.
