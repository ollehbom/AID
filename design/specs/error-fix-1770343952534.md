# Design Specification: Establish Core React Application (error-fix-1770343952534)

## 1. Overview
This document details the design specifications for the foundational React application, incorporating `shadcn/ui` for a consistent design system, Google login for authentication, and a basic dashboard to serve as a starting point for future features. The focus is on clarity, simplicity, and establishing a robust user experience from the outset.

## 2. User Flow

### A. Initial Application Access & Login
1.  **User Action**: User navigates to the application URL (e.g., `app.aidpipeline.com`).
2.  **System Response**: The application loads and displays the Google Login Screen.
3.  **User Action**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
4.  **System Response**: 
    *   Application initiates the Google OAuth flow, redirecting the user to Google's authentication page (consent screen).
    *   Upon successful authentication and user consent, Google redirects the user back to the application.
    *   If authentication fails (e.g., invalid credentials, Google service error) or is cancelled by the user, the user is redirected back to the Google Login Screen with an appropriate error message.
5.  **System Response (Post-Login)**: Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the Dashboard screen.

### B. Dashboard Access (Post-Login)
1.  **System Response**: The Dashboard is displayed, featuring a header and mock content cards, indicating successful login and readiness for interaction.
2.  **User Action**: (Future) User can view the mock content and perceive the general layout for upcoming features. (No specific interactions are defined for this MVP dashboard).

## 3. States

### A. Google Login Screen
*   **Initial State**:
    *   **Layout**: Content is vertically and horizontally centered on the screen.
    *   **Elements**:
        *   Application Logo/Title (e.g., "AID Pipeline" - using a simple text logo for MVP).
        *   Headline: "Welcome to AID Pipeline"
        *   Sub-headline: "Sign in to continue"
        *   Primary Button: "Sign in with Google" (using `shadcn/ui` Button component).
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Headline: "Welcome to AID Pipeline"
        *   Sub-headline: "Sign in to continue"
        *   Button Text: "Sign in with Google"
*   **Loading State (during Google OAuth)**:
    *   **Layout**: Same as Initial State.
    *   **Elements**: The "Sign in with Google" button is disabled and displays a loading spinner or indicator.
    *   **Copy**: Button Text: "Signing in..."
*   **Error State (Authentication Failed/Cancelled)**:
    *   **Layout**: Same as Initial State, with an error message displayed prominently above the "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   **Elements**: Error message component (e.g., `shadcn/ui` Alert or Toast).
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Error message: "Authentication failed. Please try again." (for general failure).
        *   Error message: "Login cancelled. Please try again." (if user explicitly cancels).

### B. Dashboard Screen
*   **Initial/Success State**:
    *   **Layout**: 
        *   Top navigation bar/Header (e.g., `shadcn/ui` Navbar equivalent) spanning full width.
        *   Main content area below the header, organized into cards.
    *   **Elements**:
        *   Header Title: "AID Pipeline Dashboard"
        *   User Greeting (e.g., "Hello, User!").
        *   Mock Content Card 1 (e.g., `shadcn/ui` Card component): Title, short description, and a placeholder icon/image.
        *   Mock Content Card 2: Title, short description, and a placeholder icon/image.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Header Title: "AID Pipeline Dashboard"
        *   User Greeting: "Hello, User!" (Placeholder for actual user name).
        *   Card 1 Title: "Project Alpha Overview"
        *   Card 1 Description: "Quick summary of your active projects and recent updates."
        *   Card 2 Title: "Recent Activity"
        *   Card 2 Description: "View your latest pipeline runs and experiment results."
*   **Loading State (for future dynamic data)**:
    *   **Layout**: Dashboard layout with skeleton loaders or loading indicators for content areas (e.g., `shadcn/ui` Skeleton component).
    *   **Elements**: Placeholder content while data loads.
    *   **Copy**: N/A (visual loading).
*   **Empty State**: Not applicable for this MVP as mock content is always present. For future dynamic content, an empty state would include a message like "No items found. Start a new one!"

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Authentication Failure**:
    *   **Cause**: Invalid Google credentials, Google service outage, user denies consent, or network issues during the OAuth redirect.
    *   **Handling**: The user is redirected back to the Google Login Screen. An error message (e.g., "Authentication failed. Please try again.") is displayed to inform the user. The user can then retry the login process.
*   **Network Errors (during initial load or post-login)**:
    *   **Cause**: User's internet connection is unstable or drops.
    *   **Handling**: A generic network error message should be displayed. For the login screen, this would appear as a toast or alert. For dashboard content, a full-screen overlay or a toast indicating connection issues would be appropriate. The application should attempt to gracefully recover or allow the user to retry.
*   **Session Expiration/Invalidation**:
    *   **Cause**: The user's authentication token expires or becomes invalid while using the dashboard.
    *   **Handling**: The user is automatically redirected to the Google Login Screen. No explicit error message is strictly necessary on initial redirect, as the login screen implies the need to re-authenticate. (Future enhancement: A small toast "Your session has expired. Please sign in again." could be considered).

## 5. Transitions and Animations

*   **Button Click (Login)**: A subtle press or hover effect on the "Sign in with Google" button (native `shadcn/ui` button behavior).
*   **Page Load (Dashboard)**: A simple fade-in or slide-up animation for the main dashboard content after successful authentication to provide a smooth visual transition from the login screen.
*   **Loading Indicators**: A small spinner within the "Signing in..." button during the Google OAuth process to indicate active authentication.
