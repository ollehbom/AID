# Design Specification: Foundational React App & Design System (error-fix-1770411827009)This document outlines the design specification for the initial React application, encompassing Google authentication and a basic dashboard. The primary goal is to establish a modern, consistent UI/UX foundation that aligns with our core beliefs: "The product must feel obvious without documentation," "Users value speed over configurability," and "The primary user is technically competent."## 1. User FlowThe user flow is designed to be minimal and direct, guiding the user from initial access to a personalized dashboard with minimal friction.1.  **Access Application:**    *   User navigates to the application's URL (e.g., `app.product.com`).    *   **Trigger:** Browser request.2.  **Initial Load & Authentication Prompt:**    *   The application performs a quick initial load. If no active session is found, it presents a welcome screen with a clear call to action for authentication.    *   **Trigger:** Application loaded, no active session.3.  **Google Authentication Initiation:**    *   User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.    *   **Trigger:** User interaction.4.  **Google OAuth Flow:**    *   The user is redirected to Google's secure authentication page.    *   User completes the Google sign-in process and grants necessary permissions.    *   **Trigger:** Browser redirect, Google interaction.5.  **Post-Authentication Redirect & Dashboard Loading:**    *   Upon successful authentication, Google redirects the user back to the application.    *   The application verifies the authentication token and initiates the loading of the user's dashboard.    *   **Trigger:** Google redirect with authentication token.6.  **Dashboard Display:**    *   The personalized dashboard is rendered, displaying foundational mock content.    *   **Trigger:** Dashboard data loaded and processed.## 2. All Possible States & Copy### 2.1. Application Loading (Initial)*   **Description:** Displayed while the core application bundle is being fetched and initialized.*   **UI:** Centered spinner or a simple brand logo with a text message.*   **Copy:** "Loading application..."*   **Transitions:** Fades into the Welcome Screen or Dashboard upon completion.### 2.2. Welcome Screen / Pre-Authentication*   **Description:** The landing page for users without an active session, prompting them to sign in.*   **UI:** Clean, minimalist layout. Centered main heading, a brief explanatory sentence, and a prominent "Sign in with Google" button.*   **Copy:**    *   **Heading:** "Welcome to [Product Name]"    *   **Body:** "Please sign in to continue your journey."    *   **Button:** "Sign in with Google"*   **Transitions:** Clicking the button initiates a redirect to Google.### 2.3. Authentication In Progress*   **Description:** Briefly shown after the user clicks "Sign in with Google" and before the browser redirects to Google's OAuth page.*   **UI:** Full-screen overlay or a small, inline spinner next to the button.*   **Copy:** "Redirecting to Google..." or "Signing in..."*   **Transitions:** Rapid redirect.### 2.4. Authentication Error*   **Description:** If Google authentication fails (e.g., user cancels, network error during OAuth, or backend token verification fails).*   **UI:** An alert or dismissible banner displayed on the Welcome Screen.*   **Copy:**    *   **Message:** "Authentication failed. Please try again."    *   **(Optional Detail):** "Error: [Specific error details if available, e.g., 'User cancelled login.']"    *   **Action:** The "Sign in with Google" button remains available.*   **Error Handling:** Logs the error for debugging. User can retry immediately.### 2.5. Dashboard Loading (Post-Authentication)*   **Description:** Displayed while user-specific data and dashboard components are being fetched and prepared after successful authentication.*   **UI:** Centered spinner or brand logo with a text message.*   **Copy:** "Loading your dashboard..."*   **Transitions:** Fades into the Dashboard View upon completion.### 2.6. Dashboard View (Success)*   **Description:** The primary interface after successful login, displaying core information and navigation.*   **UI:**    *   Top Navigation Bar: Simple logo/brand name, User avatar/name (e.g., "Hello, [User's First Name]"), (Logout button - implicit for foundational, explicit later).    *   Main Content Area: A "Welcome" section and at least one mock content card.*   **Copy:**    *   **Nav User Info:** "Hello, [User's First Name]"    *   **Main Heading:** "Dashboard"    *   **Card 1 Title:** "Getting Started"    *   **Card 1 Body:** "Welcome to your personalized dashboard! This is where your journey begins. More features and insights will appear here soon."    *   **Card 2 Title:** "Quick Actions"    *   **Card 2 Body:** "• View Documentation (Coming Soon) • Contact Support (Coming Soon)"*   **Transitions:** Static display, interactive elements will be added in future features.## 3. Error Handling and Edge Cases*   **Network Interruption (Initial Load):** Handled by the browser (e.g., "This site can't be reached").*   **Network Interruption (API Calls Post-Auth):** For this foundational stage, if a dashboard data fetch fails, a generic "Failed to load dashboard. Please refresh or try again later." message will be displayed, along with a "Refresh" button.*   **Google Auth Token Expiry/Invalidation:** Not explicitly handled in this foundational MVP beyond the initial login. Future iterations will implement token refresh mechanisms. For now, if a session becomes invalid, the user will be redirected to the Welcome Screen.*   **User Logout:** Not explicitly part of this foundational scope but will be a simple button action in the top nav in future iterations, clearing the local session and redirecting to the Welcome Screen.## 4. Transitions and Animations*   **General:** Transitions should be subtle and fast to reinforce the "speed over configurability" belief.*   **Loading States:** Simple cross-fades or fade-ins/outs (e.g., 200-300ms duration) for `Application Loading` and `Dashboard Loading` states.*   **Authentication:** Standard browser redirects for the Google OAuth flow. No custom animations here.This specification provides a clear blueprint for the initial UI, ensuring consistency and a smooth user experience from the very first interaction.
