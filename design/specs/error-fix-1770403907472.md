### 1. Overview
This document details the design specification for the foundational React application, encompassing a modern design system (shadcn/ui), Google OAuth login, and a basic dashboard. This initial build serves as the platform for future product experimentation and user validation.

### 2. User Flow

#### 2.1. Application Launch & Login
1.  **User Action**: User navigates to the application URL.
2.  **System Response**: The application loads and displays the **Login Screen**.
3.  **User Action**: User clicks "Sign in with Google".
4.  **System Response**: A loading indicator appears, and the Google OAuth consent screen is presented (either as a pop-up or redirect).
5.  **User Action**: User authenticates with their Google account and grants necessary permissions.
6.  **System Response**:
    *   **Success**: User is redirected to the **Dashboard**.
    *   **Failure**: User remains on the Login Screen, and an error message is displayed.

#### 2.2. Dashboard Access
1.  **System Response (Post-Login)**: The application fetches initial (mock) dashboard content. A loading indicator may be shown briefly.
2.  **System Response**: The **Dashboard Screen** is displayed with mock content.

### 3. States

#### 3.1. Login Screen
*   **Initial State**: Displays the "Welcome" message and "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Heading: "Welcome"
        *   Button: "Sign in with Google"
        *   (Optional Footer): "By signing in, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy."
*   **Loading State (During Google OAuth)**: The "Sign in with Google" button is disabled and replaced with a loading indicator or text.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Button: "Signing in..." (or a spinner next to "Sign in with Google")
*   **Error State (Login Failed)**: Displays an error message below the button or as a toast.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Error Message: "Login failed. Please try again." (for general OAuth errors)
        *   Error Message: "Network error. Check your connection and try again." (for network issues)
*   **Success State**: Brief flash or transition animation before redirecting to the Dashboard.

#### 3.2. Dashboard Screen
*   **Loading State**: Displays a full-screen or component-level loading spinner while mock content is being "fetched".
    *   **Copy**: "Loading your dashboard..."
*   **Empty State (Future Consideration)**: If, in future iterations, there's no dynamic content, this state would show. For this MVP, mock content ensures this isn't the initial state.
    *   **Copy**: "Welcome to your dashboard! No activity yet. Start exploring!" (or similar for specific sections)
*   **Success State**: Displays the main dashboard layout with mock content.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Header: "Dashboard"
        *   Main Content Area: "Welcome to your dashboard!"
        *   Card 1 Title: "Your Recent Activity"
        *   Card 1 Body: "No recent activity to display. Get started by [call to action]." (or mock data items)
        *   Card 2 Title: "Quick Links"
        *   Card 2 Body: "Link 1, Link 2, Link 3" (mock links)

### 4. Copy/Microcopy

*   **Login Screen**:
    *   Headline: "Welcome"
    *   Call to Action: "Sign in with Google"
    *   Loading: "Signing in..."
    *   Error (General): "Login failed. Please try again."
    *   Error (Network): "Network error. Please check your connection."
*   **Dashboard Screen**:
    *   Page Title: "Dashboard"
    *   Greeting: "Welcome to your dashboard!"
    *   Section Title (e.g., Activity): "Your Recent Activity"
    *   Placeholder Text (e.g., Empty Activity): "No recent activity to display."

### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google OAuth Failure**:
    *   **Mechanism**: The Google OAuth process can fail due to user cancellation, network issues, or misconfiguration.
    *   **Handling**: If the OAuth flow does not return a successful token, the user is returned to the Login Screen. A dismissible error message ("Login failed. Please try again.") is displayed. The "Sign in with Google" button remains active for a retry.
*   **Network Connectivity Issues**:
    *   **Mechanism**: During initial load or OAuth token exchange, network requests may fail.
    *   **Handling**: A general "Network error. Check your connection and try again." message is shown on the Login Screen. For dashboard content loading, a retry mechanism or a clear error state on the affected component should be implemented.
*   **Invalid/Expired Authentication Token**:
    *   **Mechanism**: If a user's session token becomes invalid or expires while they are on the dashboard.
    *   **Handling**: Any API request returning an authentication error should trigger an automatic redirect back to the Login Screen. No specific error message is required beyond the standard login screen, as the user is expected to re-authenticate.
*   **Application Initialization Errors**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Critical errors during the initial React app load.
    *   **Handling**: A basic fallback error page (e.g., "Something went wrong. Please refresh.") should be displayed by the root error boundary.

### 6. Transitions and Animations

*   **Login Button Click**: Subtle ripple effect or slight scale down/up on click.
*   **Page Transitions**: A quick fade-in/fade-out or slide transition when navigating from Login to Dashboard.
*   **Loading Indicators**: Standard spinners for loading states (e.g., shadcn/ui spinner components).
*   **Error Messages**: Appear with a subtle fade-in or slide-down animation, and can be dismissible (e.g., toast notifications).

This design specification provides the blueprint for the initial implementation, ensuring a consistent user experience and clear handling of various states and scenarios.
