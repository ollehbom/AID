# Design Specification: Foundational App Setup (error-fix-1770344870440)

This specification details the design for establishing the foundational React application, including Google login and a basic dashboard, styled with shadcn UI.

## 1. User Flow

The user flow is minimal, focusing on establishing core authentication and the initial application view.

### Flow: Initial Access & Google Login
1.  **User Accesses Application:**
    *   User navigates to the application's URL.
    *   System checks for an active session/authentication token.
2.  **No Active Session (or First Time User):**
    *   System displays the Google Login screen.
3.  **User Initiates Login:**
    *   User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   A Google authentication pop-up/redirect is initiated.
4.  **Google Authentication Process:**
    *   User completes Google's authentication flow (selects account, grants permissions if necessary).
5.  **Authentication Success:**
    *   Google returns an authentication token to the application.
    *   Application processes the token, establishes a user session.
    *   System redirects to the Dashboard.
6.  **Authentication Failure:**
    *   Google rejects authentication (e.g., user cancels, error occurs).
    *   Application displays an error message on the login screen.

### Flow: Dashboard Display
1.  **Authenticated User Accesses Application:**
    *   User navigates to the application's URL.
    *   System detects an active session.
    *   System displays the Dashboard.

## 2. All Possible States

### A. Google Login Screen
*   **Initial State:**
    *   Displays the application logo/name (if designed).
    *   A prominent "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Loading State (during Google auth initiation):**
    *   "Sign in with Google" button is disabled, or a loading spinner appears next to it.
    *   Optional: A small, subtle loading indicator for the whole screen.
*   **Error State (post-Google auth attempt):**
    *   Displays the "Sign in with Google" button (enabled).
    *   An error message visible to the user.

### B. Dashboard Screen
*   **Loading State (after successful login, before content loads):**
    *   A full-screen or central loading spinner.
    *   Optional: A "Loading dashboard..." message.
*   **Content Display State:**
    *   Displays a header (e.g., "Welcome to Your Dashboard").
    *   A basic, placeholder content area (e.g., a card with "Your current projects will appear here").
    *   No empty state is defined explicitly for the dashboard as it's a foundational MVP. It will always have mock content if no real data is available.

## 3. Exact Copy/Microcopy

### A. Google Login Screen
*   **Button Text:** "Sign in with Google"
*   **Loading Indicator (optional):** "Signing in..." (next to button or as a small toast)
*   **Error Message (general):** "Authentication failed. Please try again."
*   **Error Message (user cancelled):** "Sign-in cancelled. Please try again."

### B. Dashboard Screen
*   **Loading Message:** "Loading your dashboard..."
*   **Header:** "Welcome to Your Dashboard"
*   **Placeholder Content (e.g., within a card):**
    *   **Title:** "Quick Overview"
    *   **Body:** "This is your central hub. Future features, such as project listings and notifications, will be displayed here."

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Authentication Failure:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Google's OAuth flow will return an error or null if authentication fails or is cancelled by the user.
    *   **Handling:** The application will catch this error.
    *   **UI Impact:** An appropriate error message will be displayed on the Google Login screen (as defined above), and the "Sign in with Google" button will remain active, allowing the user to retry.
*   **Network Issues (during initial app load or API calls after login):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Standard browser network errors.
    *   **Handling:** Application should gracefully handle network interruptions.
    *   **UI Impact:** For initial load, the browser's default error page might appear. For post-login data fetching (e.g., dashboard content), a generic "Network error. Please refresh." message could be displayed, or the dashboard loading state persists indefinitely until a timeout. For MVP, focus on basic loading states.
*   **Invalid Session/Token Expiration:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Backend API calls will return an authentication error.
    *   **Handling:** The frontend should detect this and clear the invalid session.
    *   **UI Impact:** User is redirected back to the Google Login screen with a potential message like "Your session has expired. Please sign in again." (While not a critical MVP requirement, it's good practice for future iterations).

## 5. Transitions and Animations

*   **Loading Spinners:**
    *   Small spinner next to the "Sign in with Google" button during authentication initiation.
    *   Full-screen central spinner when transitioning from login to dashboard, or when dashboard content is loading.
*   **Page Transitions:**
    *   Standard browser page load/redirect behavior. No custom, complex animations are required for this foundational MVP.
*   **Component Appearance:**
    *   Shadcn UI components will inherently have subtle transitions as defined by their library (e.g., button hover states, dialog openings). No custom animations beyond these are needed.
