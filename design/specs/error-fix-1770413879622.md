# Design Specification: Core UI, Google Login & Basic Dashboard

## 1. User Flow

This flow describes the initial user journey from landing on the application to accessing their basic dashboard.

1.  **Application Access**: User navigates to the product's root URL (e.g., `app.product.com`).
2.  **Login Page Display**: The application loads and presents a dedicated login page.
3.  **Initiate Google Login**: User clicks the prominent 'Sign in with Google' button.
4.  **Google OAuth Redirection**: The user's browser is redirected to Google's OAuth consent screen.
5.  **Google Authentication**: User grants (or denies) the application access via their Google account.
6.  **Application Callback**: Upon successful Google authentication, Google redirects the user back to the application with an authorization code.
7.  **Session Establishment**: The application processes the authorization code, verifies the user, creates/retrieves a user session, and stores necessary user data.
8.  **Dashboard Display**: Upon successful session establishment, the user is redirected to the main dashboard, displaying mock content.

## 2. All Possible States

### A. Login Page
*   **Default State**: Page loaded, 'Sign in with Google' button visible.
*   **Loading State (Pre-Google Redirect)**: After button click, before redirection to Google. A subtle loading indicator may be shown on the button.
*   **Error State (Post-Google Failure)**: User is returned to this page after Google authentication fails or is cancelled, displaying an error message.
*   **Error State (Post-Application Auth Failure)**: User is returned to this page if the application fails to establish a session after Google authentication, displaying an error message.

### B. Dashboard
*   **Loading State**: Briefly displayed while the dashboard content is being prepared/fetched after successful login.
*   **Default State**: Dashboard with mock content fully loaded and displayed.
*   **Error State**: If there's an issue loading core dashboard content (e.g., API failure for mock data), a fallback message is shown.

## 3. Exact Copy/Microcopy
