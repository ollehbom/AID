## Design Specification: Foundation UI & Google Login (Feature ID: error-fix-1770412727809)

### 1. Overview
This document details the design specifications for establishing the core React application structure, integrating `shadcn/ui` for a modern design system, implementing functional Google login, and creating a basic dashboard with mock content. The goal is to provide a consistent, intuitive, and efficient foundation for future feature development and an initial positive user experience, aligning with the belief that "the product must feel obvious without documentation."

### 2. User Flow

#### Flow: Initial Application Access & Login

1.  **User Accesses Application (Unauthenticated)**
    *   **Description:** A user navigates to the application's URL for the first time or when unauthenticated.
    *   **State:** Unauthenticated Login Page.
    *   **UI:** Displays a prominent login card with the option to sign in via Google.

2.  **Initiate Google Login**
    *   **Description:** User decides to log in using their Google account.
    *   **Action:** User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   **State:** Loading (during redirect).
    *   **UI:** The "Sign in with Google" button becomes disabled, and a subtle loading indicator appears, signaling the impending redirection.

3.  **Google Authentication Process (External)**
    *   **Description:** The user is redirected to Google's authentication flow (e.g., choose account, grant permissions).
    *   **State:** (Handled by Google).
    *   **UI:** Google's standard login interface.

4.  **Post-Login Redirection & Authentication Callback**
    *   **Description:** After successful authentication with Google, the user is redirected back to the application, which processes the authentication token.
    *   **State:** Loading (processing authentication).
    *   **UI:** A full-screen or central loading spinner indicates that the application is verifying the user and preparing the dashboard.

5.  **Dashboard Access (Authenticated)**
    *   **Description:** Upon successful verification, the user is directed to their personalized dashboard.
    *   **State:** Authenticated Dashboard Page.
    *   **UI:** Displays the basic dashboard layout with mock content.

### 3. States & Microcopy

#### A. Unauthenticated Login Page
*   **Initial State:**
    *   **UI:** Centered `Card` component (from `shadcn/ui`) containing login elements.
    *   **Header (H2):** "Welcome Back"
    *   **Subheader (P):** "Sign in to continue to [Product Name]"
    *   **Call to Action (Button):** "Sign in with Google" (using `shadcn/ui` Button component, possibly with Google icon)
    *   **Optional Footer (P):** "By signing in, you agree to our [Terms of Service](link) and [Privacy Policy](link)."
*   **Loading State (During Google Redirect):**
    *   **UI:** "Sign in with Google" button disabled, with a small spinner (`shadcn/ui` Spinner) appended to the button text or as an overlay on the card.
    *   **Button Text:** "Signing in..."
*   **Error State (e.g., Google authentication failed, network issue during callback):**
    *   **UI:** A `Toast` notification (from `shadcn/ui`) appears at the top/bottom, or an error message is displayed within the login card. The "Sign in with Google" button is re-enabled.
    *   **Error Copy Examples:**
        *   "Login failed. Please try again." (General)
        *   "Could not connect to Google. Check your internet connection and try again." (Network specific)
        *   "Authentication cancelled. Please try again." (If user closes Google prompt)

#### B. Authenticated Dashboard Page
*   **Loading State (Initial data fetch post-login):**
    *   **UI:** Full-screen overlay with a large central spinner (`shadcn/ui` Spinner).
    *   **Copy:** "Loading your dashboard..."
*   **Success State (Mock content displayed):**
    *   **UI:** Standard page layout (`shadcn/ui` layout components) with a header, potential sidebar navigation, and main content area.
        *   **Header (H1):** "Dashboard"
        *   **User Greeting (P):** "Welcome, [User Name]!" (e.g., "Welcome, John Doe!")
        *   **Mock Content Card 1 (Card component):**
            *   **Title (H3):** "Getting Started"
            *   **Body (P):** "This is your personalized dashboard. Use the navigation to explore features and manage your projects."
        *   **Mock Content Card 2 (Card component):**
            *   **Title (H3):** "Recent Activity"
            *   **Body (P):** "No recent activity to display yet. Start by creating your first item to see updates here."
*   **Empty State (For dynamic sections that might have no data yet):**
    *   **UI:** Within a specific `Card` or content section, display a clear message and potential call to action.
    *   **Copy Example:** "No data available. [Call to action, e.g., 'Create your first item.']"
*   **Error State (e.g., dashboard data failed to load after initial authentication):**
    *   **UI:** A persistent `Alert` banner (from `shadcn/ui`) at the top of the main content area.
    *   **Copy:** "Failed to load dashboard content. Please refresh the page or contact support if the issue persists."

### 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases
*   **Google Login Failure:** If Google returns an error or the user cancels the authentication flow, the application must gracefully return to the login screen, displaying a clear, user-friendly error message (`Toast` or in-card message) and re-enabling the login button.
*   **Network Issues:** During any API call (login, data fetch), if a network error occurs, a generic network error message should be displayed (`Toast` or `Alert`), advising the user to check their connection and try again.
*   **Session Expiration:** If a user's session expires while they are on the dashboard, subsequent authenticated API requests should trigger an automatic redirect back to the login page. This should be handled by an API interceptor.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Any attempt by an unauthenticated user to directly access a protected route (e.g., `/dashboard` by typing the URL) must result in a redirect to the login page. This ensures security and a consistent user experience.

### 5. Transitions & Animations
*   **Loading Indicators:** Utilize `shadcn/ui` spinners for all loading states. These should be subtle for button actions and more prominent (full-screen overlay) for initial page loads (e.g., dashboard after login).
*   **Page Transitions:** No custom animations are required for page transitions at this foundational stage. Standard browser navigation behavior is sufficient to prioritize performance and simplicity.
*   **Error/Success Notifications:** `shadcn/ui` `Toast` components should have default fade-in/out animations for temporary messages.
