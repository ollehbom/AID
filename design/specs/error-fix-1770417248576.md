### Design Specification: Initial Application Setup & Google Login

#### 1. Overview
This document details the design specification for the foundational React application, integrating shadcn/ui, Google login, and a basic dashboard. The goal is to provide a robust and intuitive entry point for users to access the product.

#### 2. User Flow: Google Login & Dashboard Access

**2.1 Unauthenticated User Flow**
1.  **User arrives at the product's root URL.**
    *   **State**: Unauthenticated Landing Page / Login Page.
    *   **UI**: Displays the product logo, a brief welcome message, and a 'Sign in with Google' button.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Header: "Welcome to [Product Name]"
        *   Body: "Get started by signing in with your Google account."
        *   Button: "Sign in with Google"
2.  **User clicks "Sign in with Google" button.**
    *   **State**: Initiating Google OAuth.
    *   **UI**: Button state changes to 'Loading' (spinner or disabled state).
    *   **Copy**: Button: "Signing in..."
3.  **User is redirected to Google's OAuth consent screen.** (External to our application)
    *   **State**: External Google OAuth flow.
4.  **User successfully authenticates and grants permission on Google's side.**
    *   **State**: Redirecting back to application / Authenticating.
    *   **UI**: A brief loading screen or spinner might be displayed on the application's side.
    *   **Copy**: "Logging you in..."
5.  **Application receives OAuth token and processes login.**
    *   **State**: Authenticated, redirecting to Dashboard.
    *   **UI**: Seamless transition to the Dashboard.
6.  **User lands on the Dashboard.**
    *   **State**: Authenticated Dashboard.
    *   **UI**: Displays a welcome message, basic navigation, and mock content.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Header: "Dashboard"
        *   Greeting: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
        *   Placeholder content: "This is your personalized dashboard. More features coming soon!"

**2.2 Error Flow: Google Login Failure**
1.  **User clicks "Sign in with Google".**
2.  **Google OAuth fails (e.g., user cancels, network error during OAuth, Google API issues, permissions denied).**
    *   **State**: Login Error.
    *   **UI**: User is redirected back to the Login Page. An error message appears at the top or near the login button.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Error Message (Generic): "Login failed. Please try again."
        *   Error Message (Cancelled): "Login cancelled. Please sign in to continue."
        *   Error Message (Unexpected): "Something went wrong during login. Please try again or contact support."
    *   **Action**: User can retry login.

#### 3. Application States

**3.1 Login Page States**
*   **Initial**: As described in 2.1, step 1.
*   **Loading (Google OAuth)**: As described in 2.1, step 2 & 4. Visual: Spinner or disabled button with "Signing in...".
*   **Error**: As described in 2.2. Visual: Red error banner/toast or text below the button.

**3.2 Dashboard States**
*   **Loading (Initial Data)**: After successful login, before dashboard content is fully loaded. Visual: Full-screen spinner or skeleton loader. Copy: "Loading your dashboard..."
*   **Success**: As described in 2.1, step 6. Visual: All dashboard components rendered.
*   **Error (Dashboard Data Fetch)**: If dashboard content fails to load after login. Visual: Error banner/toast at the top of the dashboard area, or specific component error states. Copy: "Failed to load dashboard content. Please refresh the page or try again later.", "Error fetching data. [Retry Button]"

#### 4. Copy/Microcopy

**Login Page:**
*   Header: "Welcome to [Product Name]"
*   Body: "Get started by signing in with your Google account."
*   Button (Initial): "Sign in with Google"
*   Button (Loading): "Signing in..."
*   Error (Generic): "Login failed. Please try again."
*   Error (Specific - Cancelled): "Login cancelled. Please sign in to continue."
*   Error (Unexpected): "Something went wrong during login. Please try again or contact support."

**Dashboard Page:**
*   Header: "Dashboard"
*   Greeting: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
*   Placeholder Content: "This is your personalized dashboard. More features coming soon!"
*   Loading: "Loading your dashboard..."
*   Error (Data Fetch): "Failed to load dashboard content. Please refresh the page or try again later."
*   Error Button: "Refresh"

#### 5. Error Handling & Edge Cases

*   **Google OAuth Failure/Cancellation**: Redirect back to the login page with a clear, concise error message. Log the error for debugging.
*   **Network Issues**: Display a generic network error message. For login, return to the login page. For dashboard data, display an error state within the dashboard content area with a retry option.
*   **Backend API Errors**: If the backend fails to process the OAuth token or retrieve user data, display a generic "Something went wrong" on the login page or "Failed to load dashboard" on the dashboard. Provide retry/support options.
*   **Session Expiry (Future Consideration)**: Gracefully redirect to the login page with an appropriate message (e.g., "Your session has expired. Please log in again.").

#### 6. Transitions and Animations

*   **Button Loading States**: Subtle spinner or pulse animation on the "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Page Transitions**: Smooth fade-in/fade-out or slide transition between login and dashboard pages.
*   **Dashboard Loading**: Skeleton loaders for content areas or a central spinner while initial data is fetched.
*   **Error Messages**: Appear with a subtle slide-down or fade-in animation.
