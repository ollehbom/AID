# Design Specification: Foundational UI Development (error-fix-1770417770622)

This specification outlines the design for the core React application, including shadcn/ui integration, Google login, and a basic dashboard, serving as the foundational UI/UX.

## 1. User Flow

### 1.1 Application Launch & Initial Load
1.  **User Action**: User navigates to the application URL.
2.  **System Response**: Application initiates loading.
3.  **Visual**: Displays a full-screen loading spinner/indicator.

### 1.2 Google Login
1.  **System Response**: Upon successful application load, the login screen is presented.
2.  **User Action**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
3.  **System Response**: Application initiates Google OAuth flow. User is redirected to Google's authentication page or a pop-up appears.
4.  **User Action**: User authenticates with Google (selects account, grants permissions).
5.  **System Response**: Upon successful authentication, Google redirects back to the application. Application processes authentication token.
6.  **Visual**: During token processing, a small inline spinner might appear next to the button or a toast notification "Signing in..." appears.

### 1.3 Dashboard Display
1.  **System Response**: Upon successful login and token processing, the user is redirected to the main dashboard.
2.  **Visual**: Dashboard loads, displaying a welcome message and placeholder content.

## 2. All Possible States

### 2.1 Application Loading State
*   **Description**: Initial application startup or full page reload.
*   **Visual**: Centered full-screen spinner (e.g., shadcn/ui's `Spinner` component).
*   **Copy**: None on screen, or subtle "Loading..." if desired, but speed is prioritized.

### 2.2 Login Screen - Idle State
*   **Description**: User is presented with the option to log in.
*   **Visual**: Centered card or container with a prominent button.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Header**: "Welcome to [Product Name]"
    *   **Body**: "Sign in to continue."
    *   **Button**: "Sign in with Google" (with Google icon if possible)

### 2.3 Login Screen - Authenticating State
*   **Description**: User has clicked "Sign in with Google" and is awaiting Google's response or redirection.
*   **Visual**: "Sign in with Google" button is disabled, possibly with an inline spinner.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Button (disabled)**: "Signing in..."
    *   **Optional Toast**: "Redirecting to Google for authentication..."

### 2.4 Login Screen - Error State
*   **Description**: Google authentication failed or a network error occurred during login.
*   **Visual**: Error message displayed prominently, "Sign in with Google" button re-enabled.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Error Message**: "Login failed. Please try again." or "Could not connect to Google. Check your internet connection."
    *   **Button**: "Sign in with Google"

### 2.5 Dashboard - Loading State
*   **Description**: Dashboard content is being fetched after successful login.
*   **Visual**: Main content area displays a skeleton loader or a centered spinner.
*   **Copy**: "Loading your dashboard..."

### 2.6 Dashboard - Idle/Success State
*   **Description**: Dashboard content is successfully loaded and displayed.
*   **Visual**: Layout with header, navigation (if any), and main content area.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Header**: "Welcome, [User Name]!" or "Your Dashboard"
    *   **Main Content**: Placeholder text like "No active items. Get started by creating your first project!" or a simple list of default items.

### 2.7 Dashboard - Error State
*   **Description**: Failed to fetch dashboard data after login.
*   **Visual**: Main content area displays an error message with a retry option.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Error Message**: "Failed to load dashboard content. Please try again."
    *   **Button**: "Refresh Data"

## 3. Copy/Microcopy
*   **App Title**: [Product Name]
*   **Login Welcome**: "Welcome to [Product Name]"
*   **Login Prompt**: "Sign in to continue."
*   **Login Button**: "Sign in with Google"
*   **Login In Progress**: "Signing in..."
*   **Login Failure**: "Login failed. Please try again."
*   **Network Error (Login)**: "Could not connect to Google. Check your internet connection."
*   **Dashboard Welcome (Header)**: "Welcome, [User Name]!" (or fallback to "Your Dashboard")
*   **Dashboard Empty State**: "No active items. Get started by creating your first project!"
*   **Dashboard Loading**: "Loading your dashboard..."
*   **Dashboard Data Error**: "Failed to load dashboard content. Please try again."
*   **Dashboard Data Error Button**: "Refresh Data"

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases
*   **Google Login Failure**: If Google OAuth returns an error, display `Login Failure` message. Log the specific error for debugging. User can retry.
*   **Network Interruption**: If the network drops during login or dashboard data fetch, display a network-specific error message (`Could not connect...` or `Failed to load...`). Provide a retry mechanism.
*   **API Errors (Dashboard)**: If the backend API for dashboard data returns an error, display `Dashboard Data Error` message. Log the error. Offer a "Refresh Data" button.
*   **Unauthorized Access**: If a user somehow bypasses login or their session expires, redirect them to the login screen with an appropriate message (e.g., "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."). This is a future consideration for session management but should be noted.
*   **Invalid Redirect**: If Google redirects to an unexpected URL or with invalid parameters, ensure the application handles it gracefully by returning to the login screen with a generic error.

## 5. Transitions and Animations
*   **App Load**: Simple fade-in for the loading spinner, then fade-out to reveal the login screen/dashboard.
*   **Button Clicks**: Subtle press/hover states for buttons (standard shadcn/ui behavior).
*   **Login to Dashboard**: Simple fade or slide transition to maintain a sense of fluidity without being distracting (prioritizing speed).
*   **Loading States**: Use standard shadcn/ui loading spinners or skeleton components for smooth data loading indication.

This foundational design prioritizes clarity, speed, and a modern aesthetic to establish a strong initial user experience, aligning with the core product beliefs.
