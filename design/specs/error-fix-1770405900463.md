## Design Specification: Foundational UI (error-fix-1770405900463)

### 1. Overview
This document details the design specification for the initial user interface, comprising a Google login screen and a basic dashboard. This foundation enables user interaction and future product experimentation, aligning with the belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and "Users value speed over configurability." It utilizes `shadcn/ui` for a modern and consistent aesthetic.

### 2. User Flow

#### 2.1 Unauthenticated Access
*   **Step 1:** User navigates to the application URL.
*   **Step 2:** System checks authentication status.
*   **Step 3:** If unauthenticated, user is redirected to the Login Screen.

#### 2.2 Google Login
*   **Step 1:** On the Login Screen, user clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Step 2:** Application initiates Google OAuth flow (e.g., opens a pop-up or redirects).
*   **Step 3:** User is redirected to Google's authentication page (external to the application).
*   **Step 4:** User completes Google authentication (selects account, grants permissions).
*   **Step 5:** Upon successful authentication with Google, user is redirected back to the application.
*   **Step 6:** Application processes the Google authentication response, exchanging tokens with the backend.
*   **Step 7:** If authentication is successful and the user is recognized, user is redirected to the Dashboard.
*   **Step 8:** If authentication fails or an error occurs during processing, user is returned to the Login Screen with an error message.

#### 2.3 Dashboard Access (Authenticated)
*   **Step 1:** Upon successful login, the Dashboard screen is displayed.
*   **Step 2:** User views the mock content on the Dashboard. This screen serves as a placeholder for future features.

### 3. States and Copy

#### 3.1 Login Screen
*   **Initial State:**
    *   **Title:** "Welcome Back"
    *   **Subtitle:** "Sign in to continue"
    *   **Button:** "Sign in with Google" (icon: Google logo, positioned to the left of text)
    *   **Footer (optional, small text):** "By signing in, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy." (Links to be placeholders for now, e.g., `/terms`, `/privacy`)
*   **Loading State (during Google OAuth initiation/processing):**
    *   **Title:** "Welcome Back"
    *   **Subtitle:** "Signing in..."
    *   **Button:** "Signing in..." (disabled, with a small spinner animation next to text or replacing Google icon)
*   **Error State (after failed login attempt):**
    *   **Title:** "Welcome Back"
    *   **Subtitle:** "Sign in to continue"
    *   **Error Message (above button, red text, `shadcn/ui` Alert or Toast component):** "Login failed. Please try again." or "Could not connect to Google. Check your internet connection."
    *   **Button:** "Sign in with Google" (active)

#### 3.2 Dashboard Screen
*   **Loading State (initial data fetch - minimal for mock):**
    *   **Content:** "Loading dashboard..." (simple text or a `shadcn/ui` Skeleton component)
*   **Success State (content displayed):**
    *   **Header (top of screen):** "Dashboard"
    *   **Greeting (optional, small text below header):** "Welcome, [User's Name]!" (Placeholder: 'User' for initial MVP)
    *   **Main Content (mock, within `shadcn/ui` Card components):
        *   **Card 1 Title:** "Overview"
        *   **Card 1 Body:** "This is your personalized dashboard. More features coming soon!"
        *   **Card 2 Title:** "Quick Actions"
        *   **Card 2 Body:** "No actions available yet. Stay tuned!"
    *   **Navigation (placeholder):** A simple "Logout" button in the top-right corner of the header (using a `shadcn/ui` Button component).

### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases
*   **Google OAuth Failure:** If Google authentication fails (e.g., user cancels the prompt, invalid credentials from Google's side, Google API error), the user is returned to the Login Screen. A `shadcn/ui` Toast or Alert will display the error message: "Login failed. Please try again." or a more specific message if provided by Google (e.g., "Google authentication cancelled.").
*   **Network Errors:** If a network issue prevents connection to Google or the application's backend during login or dashboard loading, a `shadcn/ui` Toast or Alert will display: "Network error. Please check your internet connection and try again." This will appear on the current screen (Login or Dashboard).
*   **Unauthorized Access (Future Consideration):** For this foundational MVP, any successful Google login is considered authorized. Future iterations will require handling cases where a successfully authenticated Google user is not authorized within the application, redirecting them to an "Access Denied" page or back to login with a specific error message.
*   **Session Expiration:** If a user's session token expires while on the Dashboard, any subsequent API request will result in an unauthorized response from the backend. The frontend should detect this and automatically redirect the user to the Login Screen, potentially with a message like: "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."

### 5. Transitions and Animations
*   **General:** Transitions should be minimal and fast, prioritizing "Users value speed over configurability." Use `shadcn/ui` defaults for component interactions.
*   **Login to Dashboard:** A quick, standard page transition (e.g., a subtle fade or slide from the right, if easy to implement with routing library).
*   **Button Clicks:** `shadcn/ui` components inherently provide subtle hover and active states (e.g., slight background change, press effect).
*   **Loading Indicators:** Simple `shadcn/ui` Spinner components or text for loading states to indicate activity without causing perceived delay.
