# Design Specification: Google Login & Basic Dashboard

## 1. Overview
This document details the design specification for the initial frontend application, encompassing Google OAuth login and a basic dashboard. The primary goal is to provide a seamless and intuitive entry point for new users, ensuring the application feels obvious without documentation, and setting a solid foundation for future feature development.

## 2. User Flow

### 2.1. Initial Access & Login
1.  **User lands on application URL.** (e.g., `app.example.com`)
2.  **System checks authentication status.**
    *   **If not authenticated:** User is presented with the Login Screen.
    *   **If authenticated:** User is redirected directly to the Dashboard.
3.  **Login Screen:** Displays a prominent "Sign in with Google" button.
4.  **User clicks "Sign in with Google".**
5.  **System initiates Google OAuth flow.**
    *   User is redirected to Google's authentication page (handled externally by Google).
    *   User grants necessary permissions.
6.  **Google redirects back to the application.**
7.  **Application processes authentication token.**
    *   **Success:** User is authenticated and redirected to the Dashboard.
    *   **Failure:** User is returned to the Login Screen with an appropriate error message.

### 2.2. Dashboard Access
1.  **Upon successful login/authentication, user arrives at the Dashboard.**
2.  **Dashboard displays mock content.** (Placeholder cards, text, and a simple logout option).

## 3. States & Copy

### 3.1. Login Screen
*   **Default State:**
    *   **Header:** "Welcome"
    *   **Body Text:** "Sign in to access your dashboard."
    *   **Button:** "Sign in with Google"
*   **Loading State (after clicking button, before Google redirect):**
    *   **Button:** "Signing in..." (Disabled, with a subtle spinner icon/animation)
*   **Error State (after failed Google login attempt):**
    *   **Header:** "Welcome"
    *   **Body Text:** "Sign in to access your dashboard."
    *   **Error Message:** "Login failed. Please try again." (Small, red text, positioned clearly below body text)
    *   **Button:** "Sign in with Google" (Enabled)

### 3.2. Dashboard Screen
*   **Default State (Authenticated):**
    *   **Header:** "Dashboard"
    *   **Greeting:** "Hello, [User Name]!" (If user name is available from Google profile)
    *   **Content Area:** Placeholder cards/sections with titles and short descriptions using Shadcn components.
        *   Example Card 1: "My Projects" (Title), "You have no active projects yet. Start by creating one!" (Body)
        *   Example Card 2: "Recent Activity" (Title), "No recent activity." (Body)
    *   **Navigation/Logout:** A clearly visible "Logout" button (e.g., in the top-right corner or within a user menu).
*   **Loading State (Dashboard content loading, e.g., after initial login):**
    *   **Header:** "Dashboard"
    *   **Content Area:** Skeleton loaders or a central spinner indicating content is being fetched.
    *   **Text:** "Loading your dashboard..."

## 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases

*   **Google OAuth Failure:**
    *   **Cause:** User denies permissions, Google API error, network issue during redirect, invalid configuration.
    *   **Handling:** Display a generic "Login failed. Please try again." message on the Login Screen. Technical error details should be logged internally but not exposed to the user.
*   **Network Interruption:**
    *   **During Login:** If network drops after clicking "Sign in with Google" but before Google redirect, the browser's default network error will typically occur. If it drops during Google's flow, Google will handle it. If it drops during the application's token processing, it should lead to the login error state.
    *   **On Dashboard:** Display a subtle "Network connection lost" banner or toast notification. Dashboard content might appear stale or fail to load/update.
*   **Session Expiration:**
    *   **Handling:** If an authenticated user's session expires, any attempt to access protected routes should redirect them to the Login Screen. An explicit message is not strictly necessary on the login screen, as the user will simply see the default login prompt, implying they need to sign in again.

## 5. Transitions & Animations

*   **Page Transitions:** Standard browser navigation transitions between the Login and Dashboard screens.
*   **Button States:** Subtle visual feedback (e.g., slight color change, shadow, or scale) on button hover and active states.
*   **Loading States:** A simple spinner for the "Signing in..." button and either skeleton loaders or a central spinner for dashboard content loading.

## 6. Design System Application

*   Initial design system variables (primary colors, font families, spacing tokens) as defined by the Shadcn UI framework will be applied consistently across both the Login and Dashboard screens. This ensures a cohesive and branded visual experience from the application's inception.
