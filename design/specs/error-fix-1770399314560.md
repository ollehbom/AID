# Design Specification: Foundational React App with Google Login and Dashboard

## 1. Complete User Flow

The primary user flow focuses on initial access to the application via Google authentication and landing on a basic dashboard.

**Flow: Initial Access & Onboarding**

1.  **User Arrives at Landing Page (Logged Out State)**
    *   The user navigates to the application's root URL.
    *   The application displays a clear call to action to sign in.
2.  **Initiate Google Login**
    *   User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   The application initiates the Google OAuth flow, redirecting the user to Google's authentication page.
3.  **Google Authentication & Authorization**
    *   User selects their Google account (if multiple are logged in).
    *   User reviews and grants necessary permissions (e.g., email, profile).
    *   Google authenticates the user and redirects them back to the application with an authorization code/token.
4.  **Application Processes Authentication**
    *   The application receives the callback from Google.
    *   A loading indicator is displayed while the application verifies the token with its backend.
    *   The backend processes the token, creates/updates the user record, and generates a session token for the client.
5.  **Dashboard Display (Logged In State)**
    *   Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the main dashboard.
    *   The dashboard displays a welcome message and basic, static content.

## 2. All Possible States & Microcopy

### 2.1. Logged Out State (Landing Page)

*   **Description**: The initial view for users who are not authenticated.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Headline**: "Welcome to [Product Name]"
    *   **Sub-headline**: "Sign in to continue your journey."
    *   **Button**: "Sign in with Google"
    *   **Optional small text**: "By signing in, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy."

### 2.2. Authenticating/Loading State

*   **Description**: Displayed briefly after clicking "Sign in with Google" and during the processing of the Google callback.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Message**: "Signing in... Please wait." (centered on screen, with spinner)
    *   **Optional**: "Redirecting to Google for authentication..." (briefly before actual redirect)

### 2.3. Logged In State (Dashboard)

*   **Description**: The main application interface after successful authentication.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Header**: "Welcome, [User's First Name]!" or "Welcome, [User's Email]!"
    *   **Dashboard Title**: "Your Dashboard"
    *   **Content (Placeholder)**: "This is your personalized dashboard. Future features and insights will appear here. For now, enjoy the view!"
    *   **Navigation (Placeholder)**: A placeholder for future navigation items (e.g., "Settings", "Help").

### 2.4. Error State (Login Failure)

*   **Description**: Displayed if Google authentication fails, network issues occur, or the backend fails to process the login.
*   **Copy**:
    *   **Headline**: "Login Failed"
    *   **General Message**: "Something went wrong during the sign-in process. Please try again."
    *   **Specific Error (if detectable)**:
        *   "Failed to connect to Google. Please check your internet connection and try again." (Network issue)
        *   "Authentication cancelled. Please ensure you grant permissions to continue." (User denied permissions)
        *   "Could not complete login. Our servers are experiencing issues. Please try again later." (Backend issue)
    *   **Button**: "Try Again" (returns to Logged Out State)

## 3. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **User Cancels Google Login**: If the user closes the Google OAuth window or clicks "Cancel", they are returned to the `Logged Out State` on the application's landing page. No error message is necessary, as it's a user-initiated cancellation.
*   **Network Interruption**:
    *   **During redirect to Google**: The browser will display its standard network error.
    *   **During callback processing**: The `Error State` will be displayed with a specific message like "Failed to connect...".
*   **Invalid Google Token/Backend Failure**: If the backend cannot validate the Google token or encounters an error creating/fetching the user, the `Error State` will be displayed with a general "Something went wrong..." message.
*   **Session Expiration (Future Consideration)**: While not part of this initial MVP, future iterations should handle expired sessions by redirecting to the login page with an appropriate message (e.g., "Your session has expired. Please sign in again.").

## 4. Transitions and Animations

*   **Loading Indicator**: A simple, centrally placed spinner or progress bar should be displayed during the `Authenticating/Loading State`.
*   **Page Transitions**: Standard browser redirects for Google OAuth. Once back in the application, a subtle fade-in animation (e.g., 200ms ease-out) for the dashboard content upon successful login can enhance perceived responsiveness.
*   **Button Hover States**: Standard visual feedback (e.g., slight background color change, subtle scale) on interactive elements like the "Sign in with Google" button.
