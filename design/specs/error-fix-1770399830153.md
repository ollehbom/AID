# Design Specification: Foundational Frontend Application

**Feature ID**: foundational-frontend-build

## 1. Complete User Flow

This specification outlines the initial user journey for the foundational frontend application, covering application load, user authentication via Google, and access to a basic dashboard.

### Flow: Application Initialization & Authentication

1.  **User Accesses Application URL**:
    *   User navigates to the product's web address (e.g., `app.product.com`).

2.  **Application Loads**:
    *   The frontend application begins to load in the user's browser.
    *   **State**: Loading Application

3.  **Authentication Check**:
    *   The application checks for an existing, valid user session.
    *   If no valid session is found, the user is directed to the Login Screen.
    *   If a valid session exists, the user is directed to the Dashboard Screen.

### Flow: Google Login

1.  **Login Screen Display**:
    *   User is presented with an option to log in.
    *   **State**: Login Prompt

2.  **User Initiates Google Login**:
    *   User clicks the "Continue with Google" button.
    *   **State**: Authenticating

3.  **Google Authentication Process**:
    *   The application initiates the Google OAuth flow (via redirect or popup).
    *   User interacts with Google's authentication interface (selects account, grants permissions).

4.  **Authentication Callback & Session Establishment**:
    *   Google redirects back to the application with an authentication token.
    *   The application processes the token and establishes a user session.
    *   **State**: Redirecting to Dashboard

5.  **Dashboard Access**:
    *   Upon successful authentication and session establishment, the user is redirected to the Dashboard Screen.

### Flow: Dashboard Display

1.  **Dashboard Screen Load**:
    *   The dashboard interface begins to load.
    *   **State**: Loading Dashboard Content

2.  **Mock Content Display**:
    *   Placeholder/mock content is rendered on the dashboard.
    *   **State**: Dashboard Ready

## 2. All Possible States, Copy, and Error Handling

### A. Application Loading

*   **State**: `loading_application`
    *   **UI**: Full-screen overlay with a centered spinner.
    *   **Copy**: "Loading application..."
    *   **Error Handling (Edge Case: Application fails to load)**:
        *   **UI**: Full-screen error message.
        *   **Copy**: "Oops! Something went wrong. We're having trouble loading the application. Please try again later."
        *   **Action**: "Reload" button (refreshes the page).

### B. Login Screen

*   **State**: `login_prompt`
    *   **UI**: Centered card (using `shadcn/ui` Card component) with a clear call to action.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   **Header**: "Welcome to [Product Name]"
        *   **Body**: "Securely log in to access your dashboard and manage your projects."
        *   **Button**: "Continue with Google" (using `shadcn/ui` Button component)
*   **State**: `authenticating` (during Google OAuth)
    *   **UI**: The "Continue with Google" button might show a loading spinner, or a small toast notification appears.
    *   **Copy**: "Authenticating with Google..."
    *   **Error Handling (Edge Case: Google Login Fails/User Cancels)**:
        *   **UI**: A `shadcn/ui` Toast notification appears at the top/bottom of the screen, or an inline error message below the button.
        *   **Copy**: "Login failed. Please try again." or "Could not authenticate with Google. Please ensure you granted permissions."
        *   **Action**: User can click "Continue with Google" again.

### C. Dashboard Screen

*   **State**: `loading_dashboard_content`
    *   **UI**: Dashboard layout with `shadcn/ui` Skeleton components in content areas.
    *   **Copy**: "Loading your dashboard..."
*   **State**: `dashboard_ready` (with mock content)
    *   **UI**: Basic layout with a header, a simple navigation (e.g., sidebar or top nav with "Home", "Settings", "Logout"), and 1-2 `shadcn/ui` Card components displaying mock data.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   **Header**: "Welcome, [User Name]!" (or "Dashboard")
        *   **Navigation**: "Home", "Settings", "Logout"
        *   **Card 1 Title**: "Quick Insights"
        *   **Card 1 Content**: "Your journey starts here. Explore your data and manage your projects efficiently. This is mock content."
        *   **Card 2 Title**: "Recent Activity"
        *   **Card 2 Content**: "No recent activity to display yet. Start creating your first project!" (example of an empty state within dashboard)
*   **State**: `dashboard_content_error` (Edge Case: Dashboard content fails to load)
    *   **UI**: An error message within the specific content card or a `shadcn/ui` Alert/Toast notification.
    *   **Copy**: "Could not load dashboard content. Please refresh the page."
    *   **Action**: "Refresh" button (within the card or toast).

## 3. Transitions and Animations

*   **Global Loading**: Centered spinner for initial application load and major screen transitions.
*   **Button States**: Subtle hover effects and click animations (e.g., slight scale down) for `shadcn/ui` buttons.
*   **Content Loading**: Fade-in effect for content once data is loaded, or simple skeleton loaders transitioning to content.
*   **Notifications**: `shadcn/ui` Toast components should slide in from the top/bottom and fade out after a short duration or user dismissal.

## 4. Design System Usage

All UI elements (buttons, cards, inputs, notifications, loading indicators) will utilize `shadcn/ui` components to ensure a consistent, modern, and accessible design language.
