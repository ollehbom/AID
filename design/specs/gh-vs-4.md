# Design Specification: gh-vs-4 (Google Login & Basic Dashboard)Challenges: Ensure the onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance, and the product feels obvious without documentation.## 1. User Flow### 1.1 Initial Access (Unauthenticated User)1.  **User arrives at the application URL.**2.  **System detects no active session.**3.  **User is presented with the Login Screen.**### 1.2 Google Login Process1.  **User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.**2.  **System initiates Google OAuth flow:** User is redirected to Google's authentication page.3.  **User authenticates with Google:** User selects their Google account and grants necessary permissions.4.  **Google redirects user back to the application:** Includes authentication tokens.5.  **Application processes tokens:** Verifies identity and establishes a session.6.  **User is redirected to the Dashboard.**### 1.3 Dashboard Access (Authenticated User)1.  **User arrives at the application URL with an active session.**2.  **System detects an active session.**3.  **User is immediately redirected to the Dashboard.**### 1.4 Logout Process (Future Consideration, but good to define a placeholder)1.  **User clicks a "Logout" button (on Dashboard).**2.  **System invalidates session.**3.  **User is redirected to the Login Screen.**## 2. All Possible States### 2.1 Login Screen**State:** Initial view for unauthenticated users.**Elements:**-   **Header:** "Welcome!" (H1)-   **Body Text:** "Sign in to continue to your workspace." (P)-   **Call to Action:** "Sign in with Google" (Button, primary, Shadcn style)-   **Legal/Info Text (optional but recommended):** "By signing in, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy." (Small text, linkable)### 2.2 Loading State (Post-Google Redirect)**State:** Brief interstitial while authentication is processed and dashboard loads.**Elements:**-   **Spinner/Loading Indicator:** Centered on screen.-   **Microcopy:** "Signing you in..." or "Loading your workspace..."### 2.3 Dashboard Screen**State:** Main view for authenticated users.**Elements:**-   **Header:** "Welcome to your Dashboard, [User's Name]!" (H1)-   **Body Content (Mock):** "This is your personal workspace. More features coming soon!" (P)-   **Placeholder Card (Shadcn Card Component):**-   Title: "Quick Actions"-   Content: "Start a new project" (Button), "View settings" (Button)-   **Placeholder for future features:** Empty space or simple boxes to indicate upcoming sections. -   **Logout Button:** (Secondary button, top right or in a user menu)### 2.4 Error State (Login Failure)**State:** Returned to Login Screen after a failed Google authentication or backend processing.**Elements:**-   **All Login Screen elements.**-   **Error Message (prominently displayed above "Sign in with Google" button):** "Login failed. Please try again." (Red text, dismissible or fades after a few seconds)### 2.5 Empty State (Dashboard - Not Applicable for MVP)**Note:** For this MVP, the dashboard will always have mock content. A true 'empty state' for a dashboard would typically occur if there were no user-generated data, which isn't the case here.## 3. Copy/Microcopy-   **Login Screen Header:** "Welcome!"-   **Login Screen Body:** "Sign in to continue to your workspace."-   **Login Button:** "Sign in with Google"-   **Loading Message:** "Signing you in..." / "Loading your workspace..."-   **Dashboard Header (Success):** "Welcome to your Dashboard, [User's Name]!"-   **Dashboard Body (Mock):** "This is your personal workspace. More features coming soon!"-   **Dashboard Placeholder Card Title:** "Quick Actions"-   **Dashboard Placeholder Card Content:** "Start a new project", "View settings"-   **Logout Button (on Dashboard):** "Logout"-   **Login Error Message:** "Login failed. Please try again." or "An unexpected error occurred during login. Please try again later."## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases-   **Google Authentication Failure:** If the user cancels the Google login flow, denies permissions, or if there's an issue with Google's service, the user will be redirected back to the Login Screen with the "Login failed. Please try again." error message.-   **Network Issues during Redirect:** If the network fails while redirecting back from Google, the user might see a browser error page. Upon refreshing or revisiting the app, they will be back at the Login Screen. This is generally handled by the browser/network layer.-   **Backend Authentication Failure:** If the application's backend fails to process the Google tokens, the user will be redirected to the Login Screen with the "An unexpected error occurred during login. Please try again later." message.-   **Session Expiry:** (Future consideration) If a user's session expires, any attempt to access authenticated routes should redirect them to the Login Screen.## 5. Transitions and Animations-   **Screen Transitions:** Simple fade-in/fade-out or subtle slide transitions between Login Screen, Loading State, and Dashboard for a smooth user experience. No complex animations are required for MVP.-   **Button States:** Standard Shadcn UI hover, active, and focus states for buttons and interactive elements.
