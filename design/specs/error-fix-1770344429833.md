## Design Specification: Foundational UI (Google Login & Dashboard)### 1. User FlowA. Initial Access & Authentication1.  User arrives at product URL.2.  System checks authentication status.    *   If authenticated: Redirects directly to Dashboard.    *   If not authenticated: Displays Login Screen.3.  User clicks 'Sign in with Google' button.4.  System initiates Google OAuth flow. (User interacts with Google's authentication prompt).5.  Upon successful Google authentication: System processes user data and creates/links account.6.  System redirects user to the Dashboard.B. Dashboard Access1.  User arrives at Dashboard (post-login or direct access if authenticated).2.  System loads dashboard content.3.  Displays dashboard.### 2. All Possible StatesA. Login Screen States*   Initial State: Displays primary 'Sign in with Google' button.*   Loading State (Authentication In Progress): After clicking 'Sign in with Google' and before Google's prompt appears/after Google's prompt and before redirect. A subtle spinner might be shown on the button or centrally.*   Error State (Authentication Failed): If Google OAuth fails or backend processing fails. Displays an error message.*   Success State: Brief, implicit state leading to dashboard redirect.B. Dashboard Screen States*   Loading State (Initial Data Fetch): Displays a full-screen or card-level skeleton/spinner while content loads.*   Empty State (No Content): If no data is available for display (e.g., no projects, no recent activity). Displays a clear message and potential call-to-action.*   Content Display State: Displays mock data or initial functional content (e.g., "Welcome, [User Name]!").### 3. Exact Copy/MicrocopyA. Login Screen*   Header: "Welcome to [Product Name]"*   Call to Action Button: "Sign in with Google"*   Error Message (Authentication Failed): "Authentication failed. Please try again or contact support."*   Loading Message (Optional): "Signing you in..."B. Dashboard Screen*   Header (Initial): "Welcome to your Dashboard"*   Greeting (Personalized): "Hello, [User's Name]!"*   Loading Message: "Loading your content..."*   Empty State Title: "No active projects yet."*   Empty State Description: "Start by creating your first project to see it here."*   Placeholder Content (Example): "This is where your important data and actions will appear."### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases*   Google Authentication Failure:    *   Mechanism: Google OAuth typically handles its own errors, but if the callback to our backend fails or our backend rejects the user, a clear error message (as above) will be displayed on the login screen.    *   Recovery: User can retry by clicking 'Sign in with Google' again.*   Network Issues:    *   Mechanism: Standard browser/network error handling. For API calls, display a generic "Failed to load data. Please check your internet connection and try again."    *   Recovery: User can refresh the page or retry actions.*   Unauthorized Access (Dashboard):    *   Mechanism: If an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected dashboard route directly, they are redirected to the Login Screen.*   Data Loading Errors (Dashboard):    *   Mechanism: If API calls for dashboard content fail, an error message is displayed within the relevant content area (e.g., "Failed to load projects.").    *   Recovery: A "Retry" button within the error message can trigger the data fetch again.### 5. Transitions and Animations*   Login Button Click: Subtle loading spinner within the button or next to it.*   Page Redirects: Standard browser redirect, aiming for minimal latency.*   Dashboard Content Loading: Skeleton loaders for initial content areas, or a central spinner for full-page loads, fading out as content appears.*   Error Messages: Gentle fade-in/out for error toasts or messages.
