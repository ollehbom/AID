### Design Spec for Foundational Application Setup (Feature ID: error-fix-1770402949355)### 1. User FlowThe primary user flow focuses on initial access, authentication, and entry into the core application dashboard.1.  **Access Application**: User navigates to the application URL.2.  **Display Login Page**: The application presents a login page.3.  **Initiate Google Login**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.4.  **Google Authentication**: User is redirected to Google's authentication flow (handled by Google).5.  **Authentication Callback**: Upon successful authentication with Google, the user is redirected back to the application.6.  **Application Login Processing**: The application processes the Google authentication token.7.  **Display Dashboard**: Upon successful application login, the user is directed to the main dashboard.8.  **Logout (Optional)**: User can choose to log out, returning them to the login page.### 2. All Possible States#### **A. Login Page States**1.  **Initial State**:*   **Description**: User has arrived at the application's root URL and is not authenticated.*   **UI Elements**: Application logo, a clear call to action for login.*   **Copy**: "Welcome to [App Name]", "Sign in to continue."2.  **Login Pending State**:*   **Description**: User has clicked "Sign in with Google", and the authentication process is in progress (either redirecting or awaiting callback).*   **UI Elements**: Login button might be disabled, a subtle loading indicator.*   **Copy**: "Signing in...", "Please wait..."3.  **Login Error State**:*   **Description**: Google authentication failed, or the application failed to process the Google token.*   **UI Elements**: Login page with an error message.*   **Copy**: "Sign in failed. Please try again.", "Error: [Specific error message, e.g., 'Google authentication cancelled' or 'Could not process login.']"4.  **Logout Success State**:*   **Description**: User successfully logged out and is returned to the login page.*   **UI Elements**: Login page, optionally a success message (ephemeral).*   **Copy**: "You have been logged out.", "Sign in to continue."#### **B. Dashboard States**1.  **Dashboard Loading State**:*   **Description**: User has successfully logged in, and the application is fetching initial dashboard data.*   **UI Elements**: A skeleton loader or a central loading spinner.*   **Copy**: "Loading your dashboard...", "Fetching data..."2.  **Dashboard Content State**:*   **Description**: Initial dashboard data has loaded and is displayed.*   **UI Elements**: Header with user info (e.g., "Welcome, [User Name]"), navigation (if any), main content area displaying basic information or a placeholder.*   **Copy**: "Welcome, [User Name]!", "This is your dashboard. More features coming soon!", "Start by exploring..." (placeholder for future actions).3.  **Dashboard Empty State (if applicable)**:*   **Description**: If the dashboard relies on user-generated data and none exists. (Less likely for a *basic* dashboard, but good to consider for future expansion).*   **UI Elements**: Dashboard layout with a prominent message and a call to action.*   **Copy**: "Nothing here yet!", "Let's get started by [action]!"4.  **Dashboard Error State**:*   **Description**: An error occurred while fetching dashboard data.*   **UI Elements**: Dashboard layout with an error message and possibly a retry option.*   **Copy**: "Could not load dashboard data.", "Please try refreshing the page or contact support if the issue persists.", "Retry" button.### 3. Exact Copy/Microcopy*   **Login Page Title**: "Welcome to [App Name]"*   **Login Call to Action**: "Sign in to continue."*   **Google Login Button**: "Sign in with Google"*   **Login Pending Message**: "Signing in..."*   **Generic Login Error**: "Sign in failed. Please try again."*   **Specific Login Error (e.g., cancelled)**: "Google authentication cancelled. Please try again."*   **Specific Login Error (e.g., server issue)**: "Could not process your login. Please try again later."*   **Logout Success Message**: "You have been logged out." (Ephemeral, 3-5 seconds)*   **Dashboard Welcome (Header)**: "Welcome, [User Name]!"*   **Dashboard Placeholder Text**: "This is your dashboard. We're building new features to help you [achieve goal]!"*   **Dashboard Loading Message**: "Loading your dashboard..."*   **Dashboard Data Error**: "Unable to load dashboard data. Please try again."*   **Retry Button (Dashboard Error)**: "Retry"*   **Logout Button (Header/Profile Menu)**: "Logout"### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases*   **Google Authentication Failure**:*   **Mechanism**: If Google's OAuth flow fails (user cancels, Google error, etc.), the application callback URL will receive an error.*   **Response**: Display a clear, user-friendly error message on the login page (e.g., "Google authentication cancelled. Please try again."). Allow the user to retry.*   **Application Backend Login Failure**:*   **Mechanism**: If the application's backend fails to process the Google token or create/retrieve a user session.*   **Response**: Display a generic error message (e.g., "Could not process your login. Please try again later.") on the login page. Log the error internally.*   **Network Issues**:*   **Mechanism**: During login or dashboard data fetching.*   **Response**: For login, similar to application backend failure. For dashboard, display "Could not load dashboard data. Check your internet connection." with a retry button.*   **Session Expiration**:*   **Mechanism**: If a user's session expires while they are on the dashboard.*   **Response**: Redirect the user to the login page with a message indicating session expiration (e.g., "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."). This ensures security and adherence to authentication requirements.*   **Unauthorized Access**:*   **Mechanism**: If an authenticated user somehow tries to access a restricted resource (not applicable for a *basic* dashboard, but important for future).*   **Response**: Redirect to a generic error page or the login page with an "Unauthorized" message.### 5. Transitions and Animations*   **Login Page to Google Auth**: Standard browser redirect.*   **Google Auth Callback to Dashboard**: Minimal loading indicator (spinner/skeleton) while application processes login and fetches dashboard data.*   **Loading States**: Use subtle, non-disruptive loading indicators (e.g., `shadcn/ui` spinner or skeleton loaders) to indicate activity without blocking the UI entirely.*   **Error Messages**: Display error messages clearly, perhaps with a subtle fade-in.*   **No complex animations are required for this foundational phase.** Focus on immediate feedback and responsiveness.
