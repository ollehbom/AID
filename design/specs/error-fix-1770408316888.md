# Design Specification: Foundational Frontend Architecture (error-fix-1770408316888)

This document details the design specification for the foundational frontend architecture, focusing on the core user flows for Google Login and the initial Dashboard experience, adhering to the product beliefs of clarity, speed, and intuitiveness.

## 1. User Flow: Google Login

**Intent**: Provide a frictionless and obvious entry point for new and returning users.

**Beliefs Validated**: "The product must feel obvious without documentation", "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance".

**Steps**:
1.  **Access Application**: User navigates to the application's root URL (e.g., `app.example.com`).
2.  **Authentication Check**: System checks for an existing, valid session.
3.  **Display Login Screen**: If no valid session, the application displays a dedicated login screen.
4.  **Initiate Google Login**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
5.  **Google Redirect**: User is temporarily redirected to Google's authentication consent screen.
6.  **Google Authentication**: User completes authentication with Google (selects account, grants permissions).
7.  **Application Redirect**: User is redirected back to the application with authentication tokens.
8.  **Session Establishment**: Application processes tokens, establishes a local session.
9.  **Dashboard Access**: User is redirected to the main Dashboard page upon successful authentication.

## 2. User Flow: Basic Dashboard

**Intent**: Present a clear, immediate overview and a consistent starting point post-login.

**Beliefs Validated**: "The product must feel obvious without documentation", "Users value speed over configurability".

**Steps**:
1.  **Dashboard Load**: Upon successful login, the user lands on the Dashboard.
2.  **Content Display**: The dashboard displays a welcome message and placeholder/mock content blocks.
3.  **Navigation/Logout**: A clear option to 'Logout' is available, typically in a header or sidebar.

## 3. States and Copy

### 3.1. Login Screen

*   **Initial State**
    *   **UI**: Centered layout. Product logo/name prominent. A single, clear button for Google login. Minimalistic design using Shadcn UI components.
    *   **Copy**: 
        *   *Headline*: "Welcome to [Product Name]"
        *   *Sub-headline*: "Sign in to continue."
        *   *Button*: "Sign in with Google"
    *   **Validation**: "Can a new user predict what happens next?" - Yes, the button clearly states its action. "Does the UI match the intent?" - Yes, direct and focused on the primary action.

*   **Loading State (During Google Redirect/Authentication)**
    *   **UI**: The "Sign in with Google" button becomes disabled, showing a subtle inline spinner or changing text. A brief full-screen overlay (if redirect takes a noticeable moment) might be used for visual feedback.
    *   **Copy**: 
        *   *Button*: "Signing in..."
    *   **Validation**: Provides immediate feedback, preventing multiple clicks and indicating system activity.

*   **Error State (Authentication Failure)**
    *   **UI**: An alert or toast message appears at the top or bottom of the screen. The "Sign in with Google" button is re-enabled.
    *   **Copy**: 
        *   *Alert/Toast*: "Authentication failed. Please try again." or "Could not connect to Google. Check your internet connection."
    *   **Validation**: "Is anything explained too late?" - No, error is immediate. Clear guidance for user action.

### 3.2. Dashboard Screen

*   **Initial State**
    *   **UI**: A clean header with the product name/logo and a 'Logout' button. A main content area displaying a personalized welcome message and one or more placeholder content cards (e.g., `ContentCard` as per wireframe format).
    *   **Copy**: 
        *   *Header*: "[Product Name]"
        *   *Welcome Message*: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
        *   *Content Card Headline (Mock)*: "Your Dashboard"
        *   *Content Card Body (Mock)*: "Start exploring your product data here. This is where your key insights will appear."
        *   *Logout Button*: "Logout"
    *   **Validation**: "Can a new user predict what happens next?" - Yes, clear welcome and obvious content area. "Does the UI match the intent?" - Yes, a functional, albeit basic, starting point.

*   **Loading State (Dashboard Content Async Load - future)**
    *   **UI**: Skeleton loaders replace content cards while data is fetched. Header and static elements remain visible.
    *   **Copy**: (No specific copy, visual loading implies content is on its way).

*   **Empty State (No Data - future)**
    *   **UI**: A prominent card or section indicating no data, with a clear call to action.
    *   **Copy**: 
        *   *Headline*: "No Data Yet"
        *   *Body*: "Get started by [Action e.g., 'creating your first project']"

*   **Error State (Dashboard Content Load Failure - future)**
    *   **UI**: An alert message in place of the content cards, or a toast notification.
    *   **Copy**: 
        *   *Alert/Toast*: "Could not load dashboard content. Please try refreshing the page."

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Network Disruption**: During any network request (login, dashboard load), a generic network error message should be displayed (e.g., "Network error. Please check your connection.") and the user should be prompted to retry.
*   **Google Account Issues**: If Google denies authentication for reasons outside the application's control (e.g., user cancels, Google policy violation), the user will return to the login screen with the generic "Authentication failed" message.
*   **Session Expiration**: If a user's authenticated session expires, any attempt to access protected routes should redirect them back to the Login Screen with an optional message like "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."
*   **Unauthorized Access**: If a user attempts to manually navigate to a protected route without being authenticated, they should be redirected to the Login Screen.

## 5. Transitions and Animations

To align with the belief "Users value speed over configurability", transitions and animations should be minimal and performance-oriented:

*   **Page Transitions**: Subtle fade-in/fade-out for full page changes to provide a smooth, non-jarring experience.
*   **Button States**: Standard Shadcn UI hover, focus, and active states for interactive elements.
*   **Loading Spinners**: Small, non-intrusive spinners for actions that involve a brief wait (e.g., during 'Signing in...').

This specification ensures that the foundational frontend provides a clean, fast, and intuitive user experience, directly addressing core product beliefs and setting a strong precedent for future feature development.
