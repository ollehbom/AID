Design Specification for Initial Core Application (error-fix-1770411297669)This specification details the user experience for the initial launch of the core React application, encompassing the Google login flow and the basic dashboard display. The primary goal is to provide a modern, intuitive, and frictionless first impression, aligning with the belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation."### 1. User Flow: Onboarding & Dashboard AccessFlow Name: Initial Application AccessUser: New User1.  Application Launch: User opens the web application URL.2.  Google Login Prompt: The application immediately presents a dedicated Google Login screen if the user is not authenticated.3.  Initiate Login: User clicks "Sign in with Google".4.  Google Authentication: User is redirected to Google's authentication consent screen (handled by Google).5.  Authentication Callback: Upon successful authentication with Google, the user is redirected back to the application.6.  Dashboard Display: The application loads and displays the main dashboard interface.### 2. All Possible States#### A. Google Login Screen*   Initial State:*   Description: User sees the login screen, awaiting interaction.*   Copy:*   Heading: "Welcome to [App Name]" (replace [App Name] with actual product name)*   Call to Action: "Sign in with Google" (button)*   Optional: "Unlock your productivity." (sub-heading/tagline)*   Visuals: Centered login card/box, Google brand button, clean background.*   Loading State (During Login Attempt):*   Description: After user clicks "Sign in with Google" and before redirect or response.*   Copy: "Connecting..." (displayed near the button or as a spinner label)*   Visuals: Button changes to a loading spinner or disabled state, subtle progress indicator.*   Error State (Login Failed):*   Description: Google authentication fails (e.g., network issue, Google API error, user cancels).*   Copy:*   Message: "Login failed. Please try again."*   Optional: "Something went wrong. If the issue persists, please contact support." (smaller text)*   Call to Action: "Try Again" (button)*   Visuals: Error message prominently displayed, login button re-enabled.#### B. Dashboard Screen*   Loading State (Initial Data Fetch):*   Description: Dashboard content is being fetched after successful login.*   Copy: "Loading your insights..."*   Visuals: Full-screen spinner or skeleton loaders for main dashboard components.*   Success State (Content Displayed):*   Description: Dashboard data is loaded and displayed.*   Copy:*   Header: "Welcome, [User Name]!" (dynamically populated)*   Section Title: "Dashboard Overview"*   Mock Content: "Your current projects: Project Alpha, Project Beta. Upcoming tasks: Task 1 (due tomorrow)." (placeholder for initial build)*   Visuals: Layout with a header, sidebar (optional, if designed), and main content area populated with mock data cards/widgets.*   Empty State (Future Consideration):*   Description: No data available for display (e.g., first-time user with no projects). For initial MVP, this may not be explicitly hit if mock data is always shown.*   Copy: "No data to display yet. Start by creating your first project!"*   Visuals: Illustrative graphic, prominent call to action.*   Error State (Dashboard Data Fetch Failed):*   Description: API calls for dashboard content fail after login.*   Copy: "Failed to load dashboard data. Please refresh the page or contact support if the issue persists."*   Visuals: Error banner or message in the main content area, with a "Refresh" button.### 3. Copy/Microcopy(Detailed above within states)### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases*   Google Login Cancellation: If the user cancels the Google authentication flow (e.g., closes the Google pop-up), they should be returned to the initial Google Login Screen within the application, effectively resetting the flow. No explicit error message is needed beyond returning to the initial state.*   Network Offline: If the user's device is offline during login or dashboard data fetch, a generic network error message should be displayed (e.g., "You appear to be offline. Please check your internet connection.").*   Unauthorized Access: If a user successfully logs in with Google but is not authorized in the application's backend, they should be redirected to an "Access Denied" page with a clear message: "Access Denied. Your Google account is not authorized to access this application. Please contact support."*   Session Expiration: If an authenticated session expires, the user should be gently redirected back to the Google Login Screen upon their next interaction or page load.### 5. Transitions and Animations*   Loading Indicators: Subtle spinners for button clicks (e.g., "Sign in with Google"), and full-screen or component-level skeleton loaders for initial data fetches (dashboard).*   Screen Transitions: Smooth, subtle fade or slide transitions between the Login screen and the Dashboard, enhancing the perception of speed and fluidity.*   Error Feedback: Brief, non-obtrusive toast notifications or inline messages for minor errors; more prominent banners for critical errors.This specification aims to ensure a clear, consistent, and user-friendly experience for the initial release, setting a strong foundation for future development.
