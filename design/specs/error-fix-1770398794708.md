# Design Specification: Initial UI/UX and Authentication Setup

## 1. Overview
This specification details the initial UI/UX framework, including a React application with shadcn styling, Google login, and a basic dashboard. This foundational work is crucial for enabling future feature development and user interaction, ensuring a consistent and intuitive experience from the outset.

## 2. User Flow

### 2.1. Initial Access / Landing Page
*   **Step 1: User navigates to application URL.**
    *   **State:** Unauthenticated Landing Page.
    *   **UI Elements:**
        *   "Welcome to [Product Name]" (H1)
        *   Short, inviting tagline (e.g., "Seamlessly manage your projects and workflows.")
        *   "Sign in with Google" Button
    *   **Copy:**
        *   H1: "Welcome to [Product Name]"
        *   Tagline: "Seamlessly manage your projects and workflows."
        *   Button: "Sign in with Google"

### 2.2. Google Authentication
*   **Step 2: User clicks "Sign in with Google".**
    *   **State:** Loading / Redirecting to Google.
    *   **UI Elements:**
        *   Button changes to a loading state (e.g., spinner within button).
    *   **Copy:**
        *   Button: "Signing in..."
*   **Step 3: Google authentication prompt (external).**
    *   **State:** External Google Consent Screen. (Out of direct UI control but part of flow).
*   **Step 4: Successful Google authentication.**
    *   **State:** Authenticating / Redirecting to Dashboard.
    *   **UI Elements:**
        *   Full-page loading indicator or small notification.
    *   **Copy:**
        *   (Optional, brief) "Authenticating your account..."

### 2.3. Dashboard Access
*   **Step 5: User lands on the Dashboard.**
    *   **State:** Authenticated Dashboard.
    *   **UI Elements:**
        *   "Dashboard" (H1)
        *   Basic navigation (e.g., "Home", "Settings" - placeholder links)
        *   Mock content area (e.g., a "Welcome Card" and a "Recent Activity" section).
    *   **Copy:**
        *   H1: "Dashboard"
        *   Welcome Card Title: "Hello, [User's Name]!"
        *   Welcome Card Body: "This is your personalized dashboard. More features coming soon!"
        *   Recent Activity Title: "Recent Activity"
        *   Recent Activity Item: "No recent activity yet. Start exploring!" (placeholder)

## 3. States

*   **Unauthenticated Landing Page:** (Described in 2.1)
*   **Google Sign-in Loading:** "Sign in with Google" button disabled, shows spinner, text "Signing in..."
*   **Dashboard Loading:** Full-screen overlay with spinner, or skeleton loader for dashboard elements. Copy: "Loading your dashboard..."
*   **Dashboard Empty (Initial Mock Content):** Dashboard layout with static, mock content as described in 2.3. No dynamic "empty state" logic needed beyond the initial mock content.
*   **Error State: Google Sign-in Failure:** Overlay or notification at the top of the landing page. "Sign in with Google" button becomes re-enabled. Copy: "Sign-in failed. Please try again or contact support if the issue persists."
*   **Error State: General System Error (e.g., API failure post-auth):** Full-page error message or a persistent banner on the dashboard. Copy: "An unexpected error occurred. Please refresh the page. If the problem continues, contact support."
*   **Success State:** (Implicit in successful navigation to dashboard).

## 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases

*   **Google Auth Failure:** User is redirected back to the landing page. A persistent, dismissible error banner appears. The "Sign in with Google" button is re-enabled.
*   **Network Interruption during Auth:** If during redirect, browser handles. If during API call post-Google, show a general error message and allow retry.
*   **User cancels Google Auth:** User is redirected back to the landing page without signing in. No explicit error message is displayed, as this is a user-initiated action.
*   **Session Expiry (Future Consideration):** For this initial setup, basic session management is assumed. In later stages, if a user's session expires, they should be redirected to the landing page with a message "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."

## 5. Transitions & Animations

*   **Button Click (Sign in with Google):** Subtle loading spinner within the button.
*   **Page Load (Dashboard):** A brief, central spinner or skeleton loader for the dashboard content before it fully renders.
*   **Error Notification:** Fade-in/slide-down animation for error banners.
