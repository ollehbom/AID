## Design Specification: Frontend Foundation (error-fix-1770402428642)

This document outlines the design for the foundational frontend architecture, including the Google login flow and a basic dashboard. The design prioritizes clarity, simplicity, and adherence to established modern UI patterns to ensure an intuitive user experience.

### 1. User Flow

**A. Initial Access / No Session**
1.  **User navigates to the application URL.**
2.  **System checks for existing authentication/session.**
3.  **If no valid session is found**, the user is redirected to the Google Login Screen.
4.  **User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.**
5.  **User authenticates via the Google OAuth flow** (handled externally by Google, then a callback to our application).
6.  **If authentication is successful**, the system establishes a user session.
7.  **User is redirected to the Dashboard.**
8.  **If authentication fails**, the user remains on the Google Login Screen, and an error message is displayed.

**B. Existing Session**
1.  **User navigates to the application URL.**
2.  **System checks for an existing, valid session.**
3.  **If a valid session exists**, the user is automatically redirected directly to the Dashboard.

**C. Logout**
1.  **User is on the Dashboard.**
2.  **User clicks the "Logout" button/link** (typically in a header or user menu).
3.  **System invalidates the user's session.**
4.  **User is redirected to the Google Login Screen.**

### 2. States & 3. Copy/Microcopy

**A. Google Login Screen**
*   **State: Initial Load**
    *   **UI**: Centered card or panel on a neutral background. Contains a prominent heading, a brief explanatory message, and a "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   **Microcopy**:
        *   Heading: "Welcome"
        *   Body: "Sign in to continue to [App Name]."
        *   Button: "Sign in with Google" (accompanied by the official Google logo).
*   **State: Loading (after button click, before Google OAuth popup/redirect)**
    *   **UI**: The "Sign in with Google" button will display a subtle loading spinner or change its text to indicate activity.
    *   **Microcopy**:
        *   Button: "Signing in..."
*   **State: Error (e.g., Google OAuth failure, network issue during login)**
    *   **UI**: The login screen remains visible. A clear, concise error message is displayed, typically above the button or as a toast notification.
    *   **Microcopy**:
        *   Error message: "Authentication failed. Please try again." or "Could not sign you in. Please check your internet connection and try again."

**B. Dashboard**
*   **State: Initial Load (after successful login, before content is fully rendered)**
    *   **UI**: A basic layout with a header. Main content areas may show skeleton loaders or a central loading spinner.
    *   **Microcopy**: (If visible) "Loading your dashboard..."
*   **State: Content Display (Basic Dashboard)**
    *   **UI**: 
        *   **Header**: Displays "Dashboard" on the left. Top-right typically contains a user icon/menu with a "Logout" option.
        *   **Greeting**: A personalized greeting, e.g., "Hello, [User's Name]!"
        *   **Content Cards**: Placeholder cards for mock content, styled using `shadcn/ui` components.
    *   **Microcopy**:
        *   Header Title: "Dashboard"
        *   Greeting: "Hello, [User's Name]!"
        *   Card 1 Title: "Your Overview"
        *   Card 1 Content: "Welcome to your personalized dashboard. This is where you'll find key insights and actions relevant to your work."
        *   Card 2 Title: "Quick Actions"
        *   Card 2 Button 1: "View Reports"
        *   Card 2 Button 2: "Manage Settings"
        *   Logout Button: "Logout"

### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases
*   **Google OAuth Failure**: If the Google authentication process fails (e.g., user declines permissions, Google error), the user is returned to the login screen with a prominent, user-friendly error message. No sensitive details are exposed.
*   **Network Issues**: If a network connection is lost during login or on the dashboard, appropriate messages will be displayed (e.g., "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."). For dashboard interactions, this may manifest as a toast notification.
*   **Session Expiration/Invalidation**: If a user's session expires or becomes invalid while they are on a protected route, they will be automatically redirected to the Google Login Screen. No explicit error message is needed on redirect, as the login screen implicitly indicates the need to re-authenticate.
*   **Backend API Errors**: For interactions post-login, any backend errors will be caught and displayed as generic, non-technical error messages to the user (e.g., "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.").

### 5. Transitions and Animations
*   **Login Button**: A subtle loading spinner or a brief disabled state will be shown within the "Sign in with Google" button upon click, before redirecting to the Google OAuth flow.
*   **Page Transitions**: Standard browser-handled page loads and redirects will be used. No custom, complex page transitions are planned for this foundational stage.
*   **Error Messages**: Error messages and toast notifications should appear with a smooth fade-in or slide-down animation to draw attention without being jarring. Critical error messages will remain visible until user interaction, while transient messages may auto-hide after a few seconds.
