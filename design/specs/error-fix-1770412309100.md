# Design Specification: Foundational UI, Google Authentication & Basic Dashboard

## Feature ID: `error-fix-1770412309100`

## 1. User Flow

### 1.1. Initial Application Access
*   **Action**: User navigates to the application URL (e.g., `app.example.com`).
*   **System Check**: Application checks for an existing authentication session.
*   **Outcome**: 
    *   If authenticated: User is redirected directly to the Dashboard.
    *   If not authenticated: User is presented with the Login Page.

### 1.2. Initiating Google Login
*   **Action**: On the Login Page, the user clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **System**: Application initiates the Google OAuth 2.0 flow.
*   **Outcome**: User is redirected to Google's authentication consent screen.

### 1.3. Google Authentication (External)
*   **Action**: User selects their Google account and grants necessary permissions on Google's platform.
*   **System**: Google authenticates the user and generates an authorization code/token.
*   **Outcome**: Google redirects the user back to the application's specified callback URL with the authentication data.

### 1.4. Post-Authentication Redirection & Dashboard Access
*   **System**: The application backend processes the authentication data (e.g., exchanges code for tokens, creates/retrieves user record).
*   **Outcome**: 
    *   If authentication and backend processing are successful: User is redirected to the Dashboard.
    *   If an error occurs during authentication or backend processing: User is redirected back to the Login Page with an appropriate error message.

## 2. States & Copy

### 2.1. State: Login Page (Unauthenticated)
*   **Layout**: Centered content, minimal design.
*   **Header**: `Text` "Welcome to [Product Name]"
*   **Body Text**: `Text` "Please sign in to continue."
*   **Call to Action**: `Button` "Sign in with Google" (with a prominent Google logo icon)
*   **Optional Footer**: `Text` "By signing in, you agree to our [Terms of Service](link) and [Privacy Policy](link)."

### 2.2. State: Loading (During Google OAuth Redirect)
*   **Layout**: Full-screen overlay, centered content.
*   **Message**: `Text` "Signing you in..." or "Redirecting..."
*   **Visual**: Spinner or progress indicator.

### 2.3. State: Dashboard (Authenticated - Initial Empty State)
*   **Layout**: Simple header, main content area.
*   **Header**: `Text` "Dashboard"
*   **Main Content**: 
    *   `Text` "Welcome to your dashboard! This is where your journey begins."
    *   `Text` "We're busy building amazing things. Stay tuned!"
*   **Optional Placeholder**: `Button` "Explore Features" (disabled or links to a "Coming Soon" page for now).

### 2.4. State: Error - Login Failed
*   **Context**: Displayed on the Login Page after a failed authentication attempt (e.g., Google error, backend processing failure).
*   **Message**: `Text` "Login failed. Please try again."
*   **Optional Guidance**: `Text` "If the problem persists, please contact support."
*   **Call to Action**: `Button` "Sign in with Google"

### 2.5. State: Error - Unauthorized Access (Future Proofing)
*   **Context**: If an authenticated user attempts to access a resource they don't have permissions for.
*   **Message**: `Text` "Access Denied. You do not have permission to view this page."
*   **Call to Action**: `Button` "Go to Dashboard" or "Sign Out"

## 3. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Authentication Failure**: If Google returns an error (e.g., user denies permissions, invalid request), the application redirects to the Login Page and displays the "Login failed. Please try again." message.
*   **Network Issues**: If network requests fail during redirection or token exchange, a generic network error message should be displayed (e.g., "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."), prompting the user to try again.
*   **Backend User Creation/Retrieval Failure**: If the backend fails to process the authenticated Google user (e.g., database error, invalid user data), the user is redirected to the Login Page with the message: "Could not process your account. Please try again or contact support."
*   **User Cancels Google Login**: If the user closes the Google authentication window or explicitly cancels the process, they remain on the Login Page without an explicit error message, as this is a user-initiated action.

## 4. Transitions and Animations

*   **Login Page to Google OAuth**: Standard browser redirect.
*   **Google OAuth to Dashboard/Login Page**: Standard browser redirect.
*   **Loading States**: Simple fade-in/fade-out for loading indicators. No complex animations are required for this foundational MVP.
