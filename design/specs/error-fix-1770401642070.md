## Design Specification: Foundational UI/UX (React App, Google Login, Dashboard, Design System)

This document outlines the design specification for establishing the core React application, integrating Google Login, a basic dashboard, and an initial design system. It is designed to be clear, unambiguous, and directly translatable for the Development Agent.

### 1. Complete User Flow

**Flow Name**: Initial Application Access & Login

1.  **User Navigates to Application URL**: The user types or clicks a link to access the web application.
    *   **Trigger**: User input (URL access).
    *   **Action**: Browser loads the application's root URL.
    *   **Next**: If not authenticated, the user is directed to the Login Screen.

2.  **Login Screen Presentation**: The application displays a dedicated login page.
    *   **Trigger**: User is unauthenticated upon accessing the application.
    *   **Action**: Render the Login Screen UI.
    *   **Next**: User interacts with the "Sign in with Google" button.

3.  **Initiate Google Login**: The user clicks the Google login button.
    *   **Trigger**: User clicks "Sign in with Google".
    *   **Action**: Application initiates the Google OAuth flow (e.g., redirects to Google's authentication page or opens a popup).
    *   **Next**: User completes Google's authentication steps.

4.  **Google Authentication & Callback**: User completes the authentication process with Google.
    *   **Trigger**: Google's authentication process is completed by the user.
    *   **Action**: Google redirects back to the application's specified callback URL with an authentication token/code.
    *   **Next**: Application processes the authentication response and establishes a user session.

5.  **Post-Login Redirection to Dashboard**: Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the main dashboard.
    *   **Trigger**: Successful session establishment post-Google authentication.
    *   **Action**: Application navigates the user to the `/dashboard` route.
    *   **Next**: Dashboard Screen is displayed.

6.  **Dashboard Screen Presentation**: The user views the basic dashboard with mock content.
    *   **Trigger**: User lands on the `/dashboard` route as an authenticated user.
    *   **Action**: Render the Dashboard Screen UI with initial placeholder content.
    *   **Next**: User can interact with the dashboard (future features).

### 2. All Possible States

#### A. Login Screen States

*   **Default**: Displays the primary call to action for login.
*   **Loading (Google Auth In Progress)**: Indication that the Google authentication flow has been initiated and is awaiting a response.
*   **Error**: Displays a message if the Google login attempt fails.

#### B. Dashboard Screen States

*   **Default**: Displays the main dashboard layout with static/mock content.
*   **Loading (Initial Dashboard Data)**: (Future consideration, for dynamic content. For MVP, content is mock/static, so minimal loading state needed beyond initial page load.)

### 3. Exact Copy/Microcopy

#### A. Login Screen

*   **Header**: "Welcome to [App Name]"
*   **Button Text**: "Sign in with Google"
*   **Loading Indicator Text (Optional, if visible)**: "Signing in..."
*   **Error Message (Google Login Failed)**: "Failed to sign in. Please try again." or "Could not connect to Google. Check your internet connection and try again."

#### B. Dashboard Screen

*   **Page Title/Header**: "Dashboard"
*   **Welcome Message**: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
*   **Placeholder Content (Example Cards/Sections)**:
    *   "Your Recent Activity"
    *   "Quick Links"
    *   "System Status"
    *   "[App Name] Overview"

### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Login Failure**: If Google OAuth fails (e.g., user cancels, network error during Google's process, invalid credentials):
    *   **Behavior**: The application should return to the Login Screen.
    *   **Feedback**: Display a transient, clear error message (e.g., a `shadcn/ui` Toast or inline message) on the Login Screen, informing the user of the failure and suggesting a retry or checking network.
    *   **Retry**: The "Sign in with Google" button remains active for another attempt.
*   **Network Disconnection (during initial load or post-auth redirect)**:
    *   **Behavior**: Standard browser network error page or a basic application-level offline message.
    *   **Mitigation**: Ensure robust client-side routing and error handling for initial page load to gracefully inform the user if the app cannot load.
*   **Invalid Session/Token**: If an authenticated user's session becomes invalid (e.g., token expiry, manual revocation):
    *   **Behavior**: User should be redirected to the Login Screen.
    *   **Feedback**: (Optional for MVP, but good practice) A message like "Your session has expired. Please sign in again." could be displayed on the login screen.

### 5. Transitions and Animations

*   **General**: Leverage `shadcn/ui`'s default transitions for components where applicable (e.g., button hover states, dialog openings).
*   **Loading States**: Implement a simple loading spinner or progress indicator when initiating the Google login process. This provides immediate visual feedback to the user that an action is in progress. No complex animations are required for this foundational stage.
*   **Page Transitions**: Standard browser page transitions are acceptable. No custom route transitions are required for MVP.

### 6. Design System Guidelines (Initial)

*   **Framework**: `shadcn/ui` components will be the primary building blocks.
*   **Color Palette**: Use `shadcn/ui`'s default color scheme, with a primary accent color chosen for brand identity (e.g., a specific blue or purple).
*   **Typography**: Utilize `shadcn/ui`'s default font stack. Establish clear hierarchy for headings (h1, h2, h3) and body text.
*   **Spacing**: Adhere to a consistent 4-point or 8-point grid system for layout and component spacing, leveraging `shadcn/ui` utilities.
*   **Basic Components**: Buttons (primary, secondary), Input fields, Cards, Dialogs (for future use), Toasts (for notifications) should follow `shadcn/ui`'s styling and usage guidelines.
