## Design Specification: Establish Foundational UI/UX (error-fix-1770414390219)### 1. Complete User Flow (Step-by-Step)#### Scenario: First-time user / Unauthenticated User1.  **User Access**: User navigates to the application's base URL (e.g., `app.product.com`).2.  **Authentication Check**: The system checks for an active session or authentication token.3.  **Login Page Display**: If no active session is found, the **Login Page** is displayed.4.  **Initiate Google Login**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button. The button enters a loading/disabled state.5.  **Google Redirect**: User is redirected to Google's authentication consent screen.6.  **Google Authentication**: User selects their Google account and grants necessary permissions.7.  **Application Redirect**: Upon successful Google authentication, Google redirects the user back to the application with an authentication code/token.8.  **Backend Processing**: The application's backend processes the Google authentication token to create/verify the user's account and establish a session. During this, a loading indicator is displayed.9.  **Dashboard Display**: Upon successful backend processing and session establishment, the user is redirected to the **Dashboard Page**.#### Scenario: Returning user / Authenticated User1.  **User Access**: User navigates to the application's base URL.2.  **Authentication Check**: The system detects an active, valid session.3.  **Dashboard Display**: User is immediately redirected to the **Dashboard Page**.### 2. All Possible States and Microcopy#### A. Login Page (Unauthenticated State)    *   **Layout**: Centered content area. Minimalist and clean.    *   **Elements**:        *   **Product Logo**: Placeholder for future logo.        *   **Header (H1)**: "Welcome to [Product Name]"        *   **Subheader (P)**: "Your intelligent assistant for streamlined operations."        *   **Button**: "Sign in with Google" (Primary action)    *   **Styling**: Utilizes `shadcn/ui` button and typography styles. Button has subtle hover and active states.#### B. Loading State (During Google Redirect / Backend Processing)    *   **Layout**: Full-page overlay or dedicated loading screen.    *   **Elements**:        *   **Spinner/Progress Indicator**: Centered.        *   **Copy**: "Authenticating..." or "Loading your workspace..."    *   **Styling**: Minimalistic, clean, and quick animation.#### C. Dashboard Page (Authenticated State)    *   **Layout**: Simple header, main content area.    *   **Elements**:        *   **Header**:            *   **Left**: "Dashboard" (H1)            *   **Right**: User Avatar / Name (e.g., "John Doe") with a dropdown menu containing "Logout" action.        *   **Main Content Area**:            *   **Welcome Message (H2)**: "Welcome, [User's First Name]!" (e.g., "Welcome, John!")            *   **Placeholder Content (P)**: "Your workspace awaits. Start by exploring features or creating new projects."            *   **Placeholder Card/Section**: A simple `shadcn/ui` Card component acting as a placeholder for future features, perhaps with a title "Getting Started" and a brief description.    *   **Styling**: Clean, spacious layout using `shadcn/ui` components.#### D. Error States    *   **Google Authentication Failed (User cancelled or Google error)**        *   **Location**: Login Page        *   **Elements**: Error message prominently displayed (e.g., in a `shadcn/ui` Alert component or red text below header).        *   **Copy**: "Authentication failed. Please try again." (If user cancelled, could be more specific: "Google login cancelled.")        *   **Action**: User can retry by clicking "Sign in with Google" again.    *   **Backend Login Failure (Post-Google, e.g., account not provisioned, server error)**        *   **Location**: Login Page        *   **Elements**: Error message.        *   **Copy**: "An error occurred during login. Please try again or contact support if the issue persists." (If account not found: "Account not found or not authorized. Please contact support.")        *   **Action**: User can retry.    *   **General Application Error (Unexpected client-side or server-side error)**        *   **Location**: Dedicated error page.        *   **Elements**: Error message, refresh button.        *   **Copy**: "Oops! Something went wrong."        *   **Sub-copy**: "We're sorry, an unexpected error occurred. Please try refreshing the page."        *   **Action**: "Refresh Page" button.### 3. Error Handling and Edge Cases*   **User Cancels Google Login**: Google redirects to the app with an error parameter. The app must detect this and display the "Authentication failed. Please try again." message on the login page.*   **Network Interruption**: If the network drops during any redirect or API call, the system should gracefully handle the failure. For Google auth, this typically results in a Google error page or a redirect back with an error. For backend calls, a general application error message should be displayed.*   **Expired Session**: If a user's session expires, any protected route access should redirect them back to the Login Page with a clear indication (e.g., a temporary message "Your session has expired. Please log in again.").*   **Invalid Credentials/Unauthorized Account**: If Google authentication succeeds but the user's email is not authorized or provisioned in the application, display a specific error on the login page: "Account not found or not authorized. Please contact support."*   **Multiple Login Attempts**: Rate limiting for backend login attempts (if applicable) should be considered to prevent abuse, though Google handles much of the brute-force protection.### 4. Transitions and Animations*   **Minimal and Fast**: Prioritize speed and directness over elaborate animations.*   **Button States**: Subtle `shadcn/ui` hover and active (pressed) states for the "Sign in with Google" button.*   **Loading Indicators**: Smooth, non-distracting spinner animations for loading states.*   **Page Transitions**: Standard browser navigation for redirects. For SPA routing, use simple, fast transitions like a quick fade-in/out or slide effect between the Login Page and Dashboard, if `shadcn/ui` or a chosen router provides such a default.
