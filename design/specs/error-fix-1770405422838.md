# Design Specification: Foundational Frontend Application

This document details the design specifications for the foundational React frontend application, incorporating `shadcn/ui`, Google OAuth login, and a basic dashboard. The goal is to provide a clean, intuitive, and consistent user experience.

## 1. User Flow

### 1.1 Application Access & Initial Load
1.  **User Action**: User navigates to the application URL (e.g., `app.example.com`).
2.  **System Response**: The application begins to load. A minimal loading indicator (e.g., a full-screen spinner or a simple brand logo animation) is displayed.
3.  **System Response**: If the user is not authenticated, the Login Screen is displayed.
4.  **System Response**: If the user is authenticated, they are redirected to the Dashboard.

### 1.2 Login Flow (Google OAuth)
1.  **State**: Login Screen is displayed (unauthenticated state).
2.  **User Action**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
3.  **System Response**: The button enters a loading state (disabled, showing a spinner or 'Signing in...').
4.  **System Response**: User is redirected to Google's authentication consent screen.
5.  **User Action**: User selects their Google account and grants necessary permissions.
6.  **System Response**: Google redirects the user back to the application with an authentication token.
7.  **System Response**: The application processes the token. A full-screen loading indicator may be shown during this brief processing period.
8.  **System Response**: Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the Dashboard.
9.  **System Response (Error)**: If authentication fails (e.g., user denies access, Google error, network issue), the user is returned to the Login Screen with an appropriate error message.

### 1.3 Dashboard View
1.  **State**: User is authenticated and lands on the Dashboard.
2.  **System Response**: A loading indicator is displayed while the dashboard's mock content is being fetched/rendered.
3.  **System Response**: Upon successful loading, the Dashboard content is displayed.

## 2. All Possible States, Copy, and Error Handling

### 2.1 Initial Application Load
*   **State**: Loading
    *   **UI**: Full-screen spinner centered on a plain background or a simple brand splash screen.
    *   **Copy**: (None visible, implicit loading)

### 2.2 Login Screen
*   **State**: Default (Unauthenticated)
    *   **UI**: Centered card or modal containing login elements.
    *   **Copy**: 
        *   **Title**: "Welcome to [App Name]"
        *   **Description**: "Please sign in to continue."
        *   **Button**: "Sign in with Google" (with Google icon)
*   **State**: Signing In (Loading)
    *   **UI**: "Sign in with Google" button is disabled, displaying a small inline spinner.
    *   **Copy**: 
        *   **Button**: "Signing in..."
*   **State**: Error
    *   **UI**: Error message displayed prominently below the login button.
    *   **Copy**: 
        *   **Error Message**: "Authentication failed. Please try again." or "Google sign-in cancelled or failed. Please try again."
    *   **Error Handling**: User can click "Sign in with Google" again to retry.

### 2.3 Dashboard Screen
*   **State**: Loading
    *   **UI**: Full-page loading indicator (e.g., a skeleton loader for dashboard sections or a centered spinner).
    *   **Copy**: "Loading dashboard..."
*   **State**: Loaded (Success)
    *   **UI**: Main navigation (if any), Dashboard title, and mock content sections.
    *   **Copy**: 
        *   **Title**: "Dashboard"
        *   **Subtitle**: "Welcome, [User Name]! Here's an overview of your activities."
        *   **Content (placeholder)**: "Your recent activities and insights will appear here. No data available yet. Start exploring!"
*   **State**: Error Loading Content
    *   **UI**: Dashboard layout visible, but content sections display an error message.
    *   **Copy**: "Failed to load dashboard content. Please refresh or try again later."
    *   **Error Handling**: A "Refresh" button should be provided within the error message to allow the user to retry fetching content.

## 3. Error Handling & Edge Cases
*   **Google OAuth Failure**: If the Google authentication process fails (e.g., network error during redirect, user declines permissions), the user is gracefully returned to the Login Screen with a clear, actionable error message.
*   **Network Connectivity Issues**: If the application loses network connectivity during any API call (login, dashboard data), a generic network error message should be displayed, and relevant actions (e.g., retry) should be offered.
*   **Session Expiration**: While not an initial MVP requirement, the system should eventually handle expired sessions by redirecting the user to the login screen with a message like "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."

## 4. Transitions and Animations
*   **Button Interactions**: Subtle hover effects and a brief `active` state (e.g., slight background change or shadow) on interactive elements, especially the "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Loading Indicators**: Smooth fade-in/fade-out for loading spinners and skeleton loaders to prevent jarring transitions.
*   **Page Transitions**: Standard browser navigation for redirects. No complex custom page transitions are required for MVP, but a subtle fade-in of content after a full-page load is acceptable.

## 5. Design System Integration
All UI components (buttons, text, layout, loading indicators, error messages) will adhere to the `shadcn/ui` design system principles for typography, color palette, spacing, and component variants to ensure consistency and a modern aesthetic.
