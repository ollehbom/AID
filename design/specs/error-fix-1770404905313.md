# Design Specification: Core UI Foundation (`error-fix-1770404905313`)

#### 1. Complete User Flow

**Objective**: Allow users to access the application via Google login and view a basic dashboard.

**Flow**:

1.  **User Accesses Application (Unauthenticated)**
    *   **Action**: User opens the application URL in their browser.
    *   **System Response**: Displays the "Login Page".

2.  **Initiate Google Login**
    *   **Action**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   **System Response**:
        *   Button state changes to "Signing in..." (loading spinner).
        *   Redirects user to Google's OAuth consent screen.

3.  **Google Authentication**
    *   **Action**: User completes the Google OAuth flow (selects account, grants permissions).
    *   **System Response**:
        *   Upon successful authentication, Google redirects back to the application.
        *   Application processes the authentication token.

4.  **Post-Authentication Redirection**
    *   **System Response**:
        *   If authentication is successful, redirects to the "Dashboard Page".
        *   If authentication fails or is cancelled, redirects back to the "Login Page" with an error message.

5.  **Dashboard View (Authenticated)**
    *   **System Response**: Displays the "Dashboard Page" with basic content.

#### 2. All Possible States

**A. Login Page States**

*   **Initial/Default State**:
    *   **UI**: Centered "Sign in with Google" button, possibly a simple logo/app name.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Main title: "Welcome to [App Name]"
        *   Subtitle (optional): "Sign in to continue"
        *   Button: "Sign in with Google"
*   **Loading State (during Google auth initiation)**:
    *   **UI**: "Sign in with Google" button disabled, displaying a loading spinner.
    *   **Copy**: Button: "Signing in..."
*   **Error State (post-Google auth failure)**:
    *   **UI**: Login page as default, with a prominent error message banner/toast.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Error message: "Authentication failed. Please try again." (or specific Google error if available, e.g., "Google sign-in cancelled.")
        *   Button: "Sign in with Google" (enabled)

**B. Dashboard Page States**

*   **Loading State**:
    *   **UI**: Full-screen or central loading spinner.
    *   **Copy**: "Loading your dashboard..."
*   **Default/Populated State**:
    *   **UI**: Simple layout with a header, a welcome message, and a placeholder area for future content (e.g., a `shadcn/ui` Card component).
    *   **Copy**:
        *   Header: "Dashboard"
        *   Welcome message: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
        *   Content placeholder: "Your journey starts here. More features coming soon!"
*   **Empty State (Not applicable for this MVP)**:
    *   A true "empty state" for dashboard content isn't needed as a basic welcome is always shown.

#### 3. Exact Copy/Microcopy

**Login Page:**

*   Main Title: "Welcome to [App Name]"
*   Subtitle: "Sign in to continue"
*   Button (default): "Sign in with Google"
*   Button (loading): "Signing in..."
*   Error Message (general): "Authentication failed. Please try again."
*   Error Message (cancelled): "Google sign-in cancelled. Please try again."

**Dashboard Page:**

*   Header: "Dashboard"
*   Welcome Message: "Welcome, [User Name]!" (where `[User Name]` is dynamically pulled from Google profile)
*   Placeholder Content: "Your journey starts here. More features coming soon!"

#### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Authentication Failure**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Google OAuth will return an error or cancel event.
    *   **Action**: Redirect user back to the Login Page. Display a clear, user-friendly error message (`"Authentication failed. Please try again."` or `"Google sign-in cancelled. Please try again."`).
    *   **Recovery**: User can retry login.
*   **Network Issues (during login initiation)**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Frontend request to Google OAuth endpoint fails.
    *   **Action**: Display an error message on the Login Page (e.g., "Network error. Please check your connection and try again.").
    *   **Recovery**: User can retry login once network is restored.
*   **Invalid/Expired Session (post-login)**:
    *   **Mechanism**: If a user's session token expires or is invalid while on the dashboard.
    *   **Action**: Redirect user back to the Login Page. Display a message: "Your session has expired. Please sign in again." (Future consideration for robustness).

#### 5. Transitions and Animations

*   **Button Loading**: Simple spinner animation within the "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Page Transitions**: Standard browser redirects. No custom page transition animations are required for this MVP.
*   **Dashboard Loading**: A simple, centered loading spinner while data (e.g., user name) is fetched.
