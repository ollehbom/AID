### Design Specification: Foundational UI (Google Login & Dashboard)

#### 1. Overview
This document details the design specification for the foundational React application, integrating Google Login and a basic dashboard, leveraging shadcn/UI for a consistent design system. The primary goal is to provide a modern, fast, and intuitive user experience that aligns with our core product beliefs.

#### 2. User Flow

##### 2.1 Initial Access & Login
1.  **User Accesses Application:** Upon first visit or after logout, the user is directed to the Login Page.
2.  **Google Login Attempt:** User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button. A Google authentication pop-up/redirect is initiated.
3.  **Authentication Success:** If Google authentication is successful, the user is redirected to the Dashboard.
4.  **Authentication Failure:** If Google authentication fails (e.g., user cancels, network error, authentication denied), the user remains on the Login Page, and an error message is displayed.

##### 2.2 Dashboard Access
1.  **Post-Login:** Upon successful login, the user is presented with the main Dashboard.
2.  **Subsequent Visits (Authenticated):** If the user is already authenticated (session active), they are directly routed to the Dashboard upon accessing the application URL.

##### 2.3 Logout
1.  **Initiate Logout:** User clicks a "Logout" button (e.g., in a header or user menu on the Dashboard).
2.  **Session Termination:** The user's session is terminated.
3.  **Redirect to Login:** User is redirected to the Login Page.

#### 3. States

##### 3.1 Login Page
*   **Default State:** Displays the application logo/name. A prominent "Sign in with Google" button. No other interactive elements.
*   **Loading State (during Google Auth):** "Sign in with Google" button might show a subtle spinner or become disabled. No explicit overlay, keep it minimal.
*   **Error State:** Displayed after a failed login attempt. An alert or inline message appears near the login button. The "Sign in with Google" button becomes active again.

##### 3.2 Dashboard Page
*   **Loading State (Initial Dashboard Data):** If the dashboard fetches data, a skeleton loader or subtle spinner is displayed within the main content area. Header and navigation (if any) are visible.
*   **Default/Success State:** Displays a consistent header (e.g., app name, user avatar/menu, logout button). Main content area with a simple welcome message and placeholder for future modules. Utilizes shadcn/UI components for all elements (buttons, cards, typography).
*   **Empty State (for future modules):** Not directly applicable to the initial basic dashboard, but for future components, if a section has no data, it should display a clear message and potentially a call to action.
*   **Error State (Dashboard Data Fetch):** If a specific module or the entire dashboard fails to load its content, an error message is displayed in the respective area. The rest of the UI remains functional.

#### 4. Copy/Microcopy

##### 4.1 Login Page
*   **Application Title:** "Product Name" (placeholder, will be replaced)
*   **Button:** "Sign in with Google"
*   **Error Message (Generic):** "Login failed. Please try again."
*   **Error Message (Network):** "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."
*   **Error Message (User Cancelled):** (No explicit message needed, simply return to default state)

##### 4.2 Dashboard Page
*   **Header Title:** "Dashboard"
*   **Welcome Message:** "Welcome back, [User Name]!" (dynamically populated)
*   **Placeholder Content:** "Your insights will appear here soon."
*   **Logout Button:** "Logout"
*   **Error Message (Dashboard Load):** "Failed to load dashboard content. Please refresh."

#### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Authentication Errors:**
    *   **User Cancellation:** Google's OAuth flow handles this by returning control to the app without authentication. The app should revert to the default login state. No explicit error message needed for user cancellation, consistent with "obvious without documentation".
    *   **Network Issues:** Display "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."
    *   **Authentication Denied/Failed:** Display "Login failed. Please try again."
    *   **Invalid Credentials:** Handled by Google's login flow; if it surfaces an error to our app, treat as "Authentication Denied/Failed."
*   **Backend/API Errors:** If the dashboard content relies on an API that fails, the relevant section should display a localized error message (e.g., "Failed to load recent activity."). The rest of the dashboard should remain operational.
*   **Session Expiry:** If an authenticated API request fails due to an expired session, the user should be automatically redirected to the Login Page with a message (e.g., "Your session has expired. Please log in again."). This ensures security and clear user guidance.

#### 6. Transitions and Animations

*   **Focus:** Smoothness, speed, and minimal distraction.
*   **Login to Dashboard:** A quick, subtle fade-in or slide-in for the dashboard content once authentication is complete. Avoid jarring full-page reloads.
*   **Logout to Login:** A clean, quick redirect.
*   **Component Interactions:** Leverage shadcn/UI's default transitions for buttons, hovers, and form elements. No custom, elaborate animations are required, adhering to "users value speed".

This specification aims to create a clean, predictable, and performant user experience for the foundational elements of the application, laying a solid groundwork for future feature development while embodying our core product beliefs.
