# Design Specification: Core Application Foundation (error-fix-1770311013114)

## 1. Overview
This specification details the initial user experience for establishing the core React application, integrating Google login, and presenting a basic dashboard with mock content. The design prioritizes intuitiveness, efficiency, and a modern aesthetic consistent with Shadcn UI, aligning with the product belief that the experience must feel obvious without documentation.

## 2. User Flow: Initial Access & Authentication

### A. Initial Application Load
1.  **User Action**: User navigates to the application URL.
2.  **System Response**:
    *   **State**: `Loading`
    *   **UI**: Full-screen loading indicator (e.g., a simple spinner or progress bar) centered on a neutral background.
    *   **Copy**: "Loading application..."
3.  **System Response (Success)**:
    *   **State**: `Unauthenticated Landing`
    *   **UI**: A clean, minimalistic page featuring the application logo/name and a prominent "Sign in with Google" button. No complex navigation or additional elements should clutter this initial view.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   (Header/Title): "Welcome to [App Name]"
        *   (Call to action): "Sign in to continue"
        *   (Button): "Sign in with Google"
        *   (Optional Footer - for legal clarity): "By signing in, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy."

### B. Google Login
1.  **User Action**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
2.  **System Response**:
    *   **State**: `Authentication Initiated / Loading`
    *   **UI**: The "Sign in with Google" button becomes disabled and may show a small inline loading spinner to indicate activity. A system-level Google authentication popup or redirect is initiated.
    *   **Copy**: (Button, disabled): "Signing in..."
3.  **Google Authentication Process**: User interacts with Google's standard OAuth flow (e.g., selects account, grants permissions). This part of the UI/UX is handled by Google and is external to the application's direct control.

### C. Post-Authentication (Successful)
1.  **System Response**: Google successfully authenticates the user and redirects back to the application.
2.  **System Response**:
    *   **State**: `Authenticated Redirect / Loading Dashboard`
    *   **UI**: Full-screen loading indicator (e.g., spinner or progress bar) centered on a neutral background.
    *   **Copy**: "Loading your dashboard..."
3.  **System Response (Success)**:
    *   **State**: `Dashboard Loaded`
    *   **UI**: Main application dashboard, featuring a simple header with the app name/logo and potentially a user avatar/menu, and the main content area displaying mock content within Shadcn Card components.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   (Header): "Welcome, [User Name]!" (e.g., "Welcome, John Doe!")
        *   (Dashboard Card 1 Title): "Getting Started"
        *   (Dashboard Card 1 Content): "This is your personalized dashboard. Explore features and manage your projects."
        *   (Dashboard Card 2 Title): "Recent Activity"
        *   (Dashboard Card 2 Content): "No recent activity to display yet. Start by creating a new project."
        *   (Optional Footer): Standard application footer.

## 3. States & Microcopy

### Global States
*   **`Initial App Load`**: "Loading application..." (Full-screen spinner)
*   **`Unauthenticated Landing`**:
    *   Title: "Welcome to [App Name]"
    *   Call to action: "Sign in to continue"
    *   Button: "Sign in with Google"
*   **`Authentication Initiated`**:
    *   Button (disabled): "Signing in..." (with inline spinner)
*   **`Authenticated Redirect / Loading Dashboard`**: "Loading your dashboard..." (Full-screen spinner)
*   **`Dashboard Loaded`**:
    *   Header: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
    *   Card Title 1: "Getting Started"
    *   Card Content 1: "This is your personalized dashboard. Explore features and manage your projects."
    *   Card Title 2: "Recent Activity"
    *   Card Content 2: "No recent activity to display yet. Start by creating a new project."

### Error States & Handling

*   **`Google Login Failed`**:
    *   **Trigger**: User cancels Google login, Google authentication fails (e.g., network issue, invalid credentials from Google's side), or the application fails to process the Google callback.
    *   **UI**: Returns to the `Unauthenticated Landing` page. A prominent, dismissible toast notification or alert banner appears at the top of the screen, using Shadcn's Toast component.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   (Alert Title): "Sign-in Failed"
        *   (Alert Message): "Could not sign in with Google. Please try again. If the problem persists, contact support."
        *   (Action): "Dismiss" (button on toast)
    *   **Edge Case**: For persistent or critical errors, consider logging details to the console for debugging by technically competent users, without exposing sensitive information in the UI.

*   **`Dashboard Load Failed` (Future Consideration)**:
    *   **Trigger**: After successful Google login, the application fails to load dashboard data (e.g., API error, network issue when fetching user-specific content).
    *   **UI**: A dedicated error page or a full-screen alert within the dashboard area, offering clear next steps.
    *   **Copy**:
        *   (Title): "Oops! Something went wrong."
        *   (Message): "We couldn't load your dashboard content. Please refresh the page or try again later."
        *   (Action): "Refresh Page" (button)
    *   **Note**: For this initial implementation with mock content, this state is less likely to occur unless the core React app itself fails to render or fetch its static resources.

## 4. Transitions and Animations

*   **Loading Indicators**: Subtle spinners for full-page loads and inline actions (e.g., "Signing in..." button). These should be quick and non-obtrusive.
*   **Page Transitions**: Standard browser-native transitions for redirects. No complex custom animations are specified for this foundational phase, prioritizing speed and simplicity to maintain the "obvious" feel.
*   **Alerts**: Toast notifications should slide in/out smoothly from the top or bottom of the screen, consistent with Shadcn's default toast animations.

## 5. Design System Integration (Shadcn UI)

All UI elements (buttons, spinners, cards, alerts, typography) will utilize Shadcn UI components. This ensures consistency, accessibility, and a modern aesthetic, adhering to the foundational design system setup. The primary goal is to leverage Shadcn to deliver a polished, predictable, and intuitive experience without requiring extensive custom styling or complex component development at this stage. This aligns with the 'minimal friction' hypothesis.

This specification focuses on the essential user journey for establishing the core application, ensuring a clear and intuitive path for technically competent users to sign in and access the dashboard, validating key product beliefs about intuitiveness and efficiency.
