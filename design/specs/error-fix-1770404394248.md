# Design Specification: Foundational UI & Experience (Feature ID: error-fix-1770404394248)

## 1. Overview / Goal
The objective is to create the core user interface and experience for the application, enabling users to sign in via Google and access a basic dashboard. This foundational work will leverage Shadcn for a modern aesthetic and establish an initial design system to ensure consistency and accelerate future development. The design prioritizes intuitiveness, clarity, and adherence to the product belief that "the product must feel obvious without documentation."

## 2. User Flow

### Flow 1: New User First Login

1.  **User Arrives (Unauthenticated State)**
    *   **Action**: User navigates to the application URL.
    *   **UI**: Presents a clean landing page with a prominent "Sign in with Google" button and a brief product tagline.
2.  **Initiate Google Login**
    *   **Action**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   **UI**: The button transitions to a loading state (e.g., spinner, "Authenticating...").
3.  **Google Authentication (External)**
    *   **Action**: User interacts with the standard Google authentication pop-up or redirect to authorize access.
    *   **UI**: This is handled by Google's OAuth flow. Application remains in a waiting/loading state.
4.  **Post-Login Redirection & Dashboard Load**
    *   **Action**: Upon successful Google authentication, the user is redirected back to the application.
    *   **UI**: A full-screen or prominent loading indicator ("Loading your dashboard...") is displayed while user data and dashboard content are fetched.
5.  **Dashboard Display**
    *   **Action**: Dashboard data is successfully loaded.
    *   **UI**: The dashboard page appears, displaying a personalized welcome message and mock content (e.g., a list of placeholder projects or a generic 'Getting Started' card).

### Flow 2: Returning User (Already Authenticated)

1.  **User Arrives (Authenticated State)**
    *   **Action**: User navigates to the application URL while already authenticated (e.g., via a valid session token).
    *   **UI**: Application immediately displays a loading indicator ("Loading your dashboard...") and then redirects directly to the dashboard.

## 3. All Possible States

### 3.1. Landing Page (Pre-Login)
*   **Default**: Headline, tagline, "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Loading (post-click)**: "Authenticating..." text with a spinner on the "Sign in with Google" button.

### 3.2. Google Login
*   **Initiating**: "Authenticating..." (button state).
*   **Success**: Seamless redirect to Dashboard loading state.
*   **Error**: Display an alert/toast message: "Sign In Failed. Please try again." with a prominent "Try Again" button. The original "Sign in with Google" button reappears.

### 3.3. Dashboard
*   **Loading**: Full-page spinner with text: "Loading your dashboard...".
*   **Empty**: If no content (e.g., projects) exists for the user:
    *   Headline: "Welcome to [Product Name]!"
    *   Body: "It looks like you don't have any projects yet. Let's get started!"
    *   Primary Action Button: "Create Your First Project"
*   **Content**: Personalized welcome message (e.g., "Welcome, [User Name]!"), mock content cards/sections (e.g., "My First Project" with a "View Details" button).
*   **Error**: If dashboard data fails to load: Full-page error message: "Could not load your data. Please refresh or contact support." with a "Refresh" button.

### 3.4. Initial Design System Components (Examples)
*   **Button**: Default, Hover, Active, Focus, Disabled, Loading (with spinner).
*   **Input Field**: Default, Focused, Error (red border, error text), Disabled.
*   **Typography**: Defined styles for H1, H2, Body text, small text, etc.

## 4. Exact Copy/Microcopy

*   **Landing Page Headline**: "Your Product Name"
*   **Landing Page Tagline**: "Streamline your workflow."
*   **Login Button**: "Sign in with Google"
*   **Login Button (Loading)**: "Authenticating..."
*   **Login Error Headline**: "Sign In Failed"
*   **Login Error Body**: "We couldn't complete your sign-in. Please ensure you have an active Google account and try again."
*   **Login Error Button**: "Try Again"
*   **Dashboard Loading**: "Loading your dashboard..."
*   **Dashboard Empty Headline**: "Welcome to Your Product Name!"
*   **Dashboard Empty Body**: "It looks like you don't have any projects yet. Let's get started!"
*   **Dashboard Empty CTA**: "Create Your First Project"
*   **Dashboard Welcome Header**: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
*   **Example Card Title**: "My First Project"
*   **Example Card Body**: "This is a placeholder for your project details."
*   **Example Card Button**: "View Details"
*   **Dashboard Data Error**: "Could not load your data. Please refresh or contact support."
*   **Dashboard Data Error Button**: "Refresh"

## 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Login Failure**: If Google authentication fails or is cancelled, the user is returned to the landing page with a clear error message (as specified above) and an option to retry. The error is logged internally.
*   **Dashboard Data Fetch Failure**: If the dashboard data fails to load after successful login, a full-page error state is displayed, preventing a broken UI. A "Refresh" button allows the user to re-attempt data fetching. The error is logged.
*   **Network Issues**: During any loading state (login, dashboard data), network interruptions should be handled gracefully by displaying the appropriate loading state until a timeout or explicit error occurs, then transitioning to an error state.
*   **User Already Logged In**: If a user accesses the root URL while already having a valid session, they should be immediately redirected to the dashboard after a brief loading state, bypassing the login page.
*   **Invalid Session**: If an authenticated user's session expires or becomes invalid, they should be gracefully logged out and redirected to the landing page with an optional informative message (e.g., "Your session has expired. Please sign in again.").

## 6. Transitions and Animations

*   **Subtle Fades**: Use subtle fade-in/fade-out transitions for page loads and full-screen loading overlays to provide a smooth experience without being distracting.
*   **Component States**: Shadcn's default transitions for component states (e.g., button hover, input focus) should be utilized to add polish without custom development at this stage.
*   **No complex animations** are required for this foundational phase. Focus on performance and clarity.
