### 1. Overview & Intent

This specification details the user experience for the foundational React application, encompassing the initial login flow via Google and a subsequent basic dashboard view. The primary intent is to provide a clean, intuitive, and robust application shell that aligns with our core product beliefs:
*   **Obvious without documentation:** The UI should guide users naturally.
*   **Speed over configurability:** Interactions should be direct and efficient.
*   **Technically competent user:** While competent, users still benefit from clarity and a streamlined experience.

The design system (shadcn) will ensure consistency, predictability, and a modern aesthetic, reducing cognitive load and friction for all users.

### 2. User Flow: Google Login & Dashboard Access

**A. Initial Access / Login Screen**

1.  **User Action:** User navigates to the application URL for the first time or after logout/session expiry.
2.  **System Response:** Displays a dedicated "Welcome" / Login screen.
3.  **UI Elements:**
    *   **Header:** "Welcome to [Product Name]"
    *   **Call to Action:** "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   **Optional Microcopy:** "Secure and fast login." or "Continue to your dashboard."
    *   **Branding:** Prominent product logo.
4.  **States:**
    *   **Initial:** As described above.
    *   **Loading (during Google auth initiation):** "Sign in with Google" button changes to a disabled state with a spinner or "Signing in..." text.
    *   **Error:** See Error Handling.

**B. Google Authentication Process**

1.  **User Action:** Clicks "Sign in with Google".
2.  **System Response:** Initiates Google OAuth flow (opens a pop-up or redirects to Google for authentication).
3.  **User Action (Google UI):** Selects Google account and grants permissions (if not already done).
4.  **System Response (Post-Google Auth):**
    *   **Success:** Google redirects back to the application. User is authenticated.
    *   **Failure:** Google denies access or an error occurs. User is redirected back to the application's login screen with an error message (if applicable).

**C. Dashboard View (Post-Login)**

1.  **System Response (Post-Successful Login):** User is redirected to the main application dashboard.
2.  **UI Elements:**
    *   **Header:** "Dashboard" or "Welcome, [User Name]"
    *   **Navigation:** (Basic) A simple sidebar or top navigation with a "Dashboard" link and a "Logout" option.
    *   **Content Area:** Placeholder for future data/features. For this foundational stage, it will display a welcoming message and basic information.
    *   **Placeholder Content:**
        *   **Title:** "Your Hub Awaits"
        *   **Body:** "This is your personalized dashboard. Future features and data will appear here. For now, explore the foundation."
        *   **Optional:** A small card with "Quick Links" (e.g., "Learn more about [Product Name]").
3.  **States:**
    *   **Initial:** As described, with placeholder content.
    *   **Loading (for future dynamic data):** A skeleton loader or spinner within content cards if they were to fetch data. (Not strictly needed for this basic foundational dashboard, but good to mention for future-proofing).
    *   **Empty:** The current placeholder content serves as an "empty" state for dynamic data.
    *   **Error (for future data fetching):** See Error Handling.

### 3. Copy & Microcopy

**A. Login Screen:**

*   **Main Title:** "Welcome to [Product Name]"
*   **Button Text:** "Sign in with Google"
*   **Sub-text (Optional):** "Securely access your account."
*   **Error (General):** "Could not complete sign-in. Please try again."
*   **Error (Specific, if possible):** "Authentication failed. Check your Google account permissions."

**B. Dashboard:**

*   **Header:** "Dashboard" (or "Home")
*   **Welcome Message:** "Welcome, [User Name]!" (if user name is available)
*   **Placeholder Title:** "Your Hub Awaits"
*   **Placeholder Body:** "This is your personalized dashboard. Future features and data will appear here. For now, explore the foundation."
*   **Logout Button:** "Logout"

### 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases

*   **Google Authentication Failure:**
    *   **Scenario:** User cancels Google login, Google denies access, or an internal Google error occurs.
    *   **Behavior:** User is returned to the login screen. A subtle, non-intrusive error message appears below the "Sign in with Google" button, e.g., "Sign-in failed. Please try again."
    *   **Validation:** Clear feedback, allows user to retry.
*   **Network Issues (During Login):**
    *   **Scenario:** User loses internet connection while attempting to sign in.
    *   **Behavior:** Browser's native network error message may appear. If an API call fails due to network, a general error message is shown on the login screen.
    *   **Copy:** "Network error. Please check your internet connection and try again."
*   **Session Expiry:**
    *   **Scenario:** User's session expires while on the dashboard.
    *   **Behavior:** User is automatically redirected to the login screen with an informative message.
    *   **Copy:** "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."
*   **No Data (Dashboard):**
    *   **Scenario:** In future iterations, if a dashboard section relies on user-specific data that isn't present.
    *   **Behavior:** Display a clear "empty state" message and a call to action if applicable.
    *   **Copy (Example for future):** "No projects found yet. Start by creating your first project!" (For this foundational stage, the current placeholder content serves this purpose).

### 5. Transitions & Animations

*   **Loading States:** Use subtle spinners or skeleton loaders where appropriate (e.g., during Google sign-in process, or if future dashboard content loads asynchronously). Avoid jarring full-page refreshes where possible.
*   **Component Interactions:** Standard shadcn component animations (e.g., button hovers, focus states, modal transitions) will be utilized for a polished feel. Prioritize speed and responsiveness over elaborate animations.

### 6. Validation Notes (against stated beliefs and rules)

*   **"The product must feel obvious without documentation":**
    *   **Login:** The single "Sign in with Google" button is direct and universally understood. No complex forms or choices.
    *   **Dashboard:** Clear "Dashboard" header, simple welcome message, and placeholder content make it clear this is the central hub.
*   **"Users value speed over configurability":**
    *   **Login:** One-click Google login is the fastest path to access. No unnecessary configuration options.
    *   **Dashboard:** Clean layout, minimal elements, designed for quick comprehension.
*   **"The primary user is technically competent":**
    *   The UI is clean and direct, assuming users can navigate standard web interfaces and understand common authentication patterns. No hand-holding for basic interactions.
*   **Can a new user predict what happens next?**
    *   **Login:** Yes, clicking "Sign in with Google" clearly leads to Google's authentication flow, then to the app.
    *   **Dashboard:** After login, landing on a "Dashboard" with a welcome message is highly predictable.
*   **Is anything explained too late?**
    *   Error messages are immediate and contextual. The purpose of the login screen and dashboard is immediately apparent.
*   **Does the UI match the intent?**
    *   **Intent:** Foundational, intuitive, efficient, modern.
    *   **UI Match:** Yes, by leveraging a robust design system and focusing on a single, clear path (Google login), the UI directly supports these goals. The minimalist dashboard reinforces the foundational aspect.
