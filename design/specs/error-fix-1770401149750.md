# Design Specification: Core Application UI (error-fix-1770401149750)

## 1. Overview & Intent
This design specification outlines the foundational user experience for our product, focusing on a clear and intuitive initial interaction. The primary goal is to establish the core application UI, including Google login and a basic dashboard, to validate the product belief that "the product must feel obvious without documentation" from the very first interaction. We aim for simplicity, speed, and clarity, catering to a technically competent user base.

## 2. User Flow

### Flow 1: First-Time User / Unauthenticated Access
1.  **User navigates to the application URL.**
2.  **System checks authentication status.**
3.  **If unauthenticated:** User is redirected to the Login Screen.
4.  **User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.**
5.  **System initiates the Google OAuth flow.** (User interacts with Google's authentication pages).
6.  **Upon successful Google authentication:** User is redirected back to the application.
7.  **System processes the authentication token.**
8.  **If authentication successful:** User is redirected to the Dashboard.
9.  **If authentication fails:** User remains on the Login Screen with an error message.

### Flow 2: Authenticated User Access
1.  **User navigates to the application URL.**
2.  **System checks authentication status.**
3.  **If authenticated:** User is redirected directly to the Dashboard.

## 3. States & Copy

### A. Login Screen
*   **Initial State:**
    *   **Title:** "Welcome to [App Name]"
    *   **Call to Action:** `[ Button: Sign in with Google ]` (Utilize Google's official button styling and icon for credibility and recognition).
    *   **Legal/Privacy (small text below button):** "By signing in, you agree to our [Terms of Service](/terms) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy)."
*   **Loading State (after clicking "Sign in with Google"):**
    *   Button changes to: `[ Spinner Icon ] Signing in...`
*   **Error State (Google login failed or internal authentication error):**
    *   **Message:** "Authentication failed. Please try again."
    *   **Action:** `[ Button: Sign in with Google ]` (resets to initial state).

### B. Dashboard
*   **Loading State (initial data fetch):**
    *   **Content:** `[ Spinner Icon ] Loading your dashboard...`
*   **Empty State (for new users with no generated data):**
    *   **Title:** "Welcome, [User's First Name]!"
    *   **Message:** "Your dashboard is ready. As you start using [App Name], relevant information will appear here."
    *   **Placeholder for future content:** A simple card or section indicating where initial content will eventually reside, e.g., "Your Projects" section with text "No active projects yet."
*   **Success State (basic data displayed - MVP scope):**
    *   **Header:** "Dashboard"
    *   **Greeting:** "Welcome, [User's First Name]!"
    *   **Content:** A placeholder card (e.g., using Shadcn's Card component) for future dynamic data. For MVP, this might display static text like "Overview of your latest activity will appear here." or "No active projects yet. [Button: Create New Project]" if a project creation flow is imminent.
    *   **Navigation:** A simple persistent element (e.g., top-right user dropdown) containing a "Sign Out" option.
*   **Error State (dashboard data fetch failed):**
    *   **Message:** "Couldn't load your dashboard data. Please try again later."
    *   **Action:** `[ Button: Refresh ]`

## 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases
*   **Network Issues:** Client-side network errors should display a generic message: "Network error. Please check your connection."
*   **Google OAuth Errors:** Handled by redirecting to the Login Screen with the generic "Authentication failed." message. Specific Google error codes will be logged internally for debugging.
*   **Backend API Errors (for dashboard data):** Display "Couldn't load your dashboard data." message. Server-side errors will be logged for debugging.
*   **Session Expiration:** If an authenticated API call returns an unauthorized status, the user should be automatically redirected to the Login Screen.

## 5. Transitions & Animations
*   **Loading Spinners:** Use simple, modern loading spinners (e.g., Shadcn's `Loader2` icon with animation) for any asynchronous operations (Google sign-in, dashboard data fetch).
*   **Redirects:** Standard browser redirects will be used for navigation between pages. No custom page transitions for MVP.
*   **Button States:** Standard hover, active, and disabled states will be applied to buttons, consistent with Shadcn UI defaults.

## 6. Accessibility
*   All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable and focusable.
*   Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text and UI elements.
*   Appropriate ARIA attributes should be used for enhanced screen reader compatibility, especially for dynamic content and loading states.

## 7. Design System
*   All UI elements will be built using [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. This ensures a consistent, modern aesthetic and adherence to best practices for component design and accessibility. Custom styling should be minimal and only where Shadcn defaults are insufficient for core functionality.
