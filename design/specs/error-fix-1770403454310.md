# Design Specification: Foundational React Application (Login & Dashboard)

## 1. Feature Overview
This specification details the design for the initial React application, encompassing the user login experience via Google OAuth, a basic dashboard, and the foundational integration of `shadcn/ui` as the design system. The goal is to establish a robust, modern, and extensible UI platform that enables rapid prototyping and validation of future user-centric features, aligning with the belief that the product must feel obvious without documentation.

## 2. User Flows

### 2.1. Initial Application Access & Login
1.  **User Navigates to App**: A new or logged-out user accesses the application's base URL.
2.  **Login Screen Display**: The application presents a dedicated login screen.
3.  **Initiate Login**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
4.  **OAuth Redirection**: The user's browser is redirected to Google's authentication page.
5.  **Google Authentication**: User completes Google's authentication process (e.g., selects account, enters password).
6.  **App Redirection**: Upon successful Google authentication, the user is redirected back to the application.
7.  **Dashboard Display**: The user is authenticated and immediately presented with the main dashboard screen.

### 2.2. Dashboard Access
1.  **Post-Login**: Immediately after successful login, the user is directed to the dashboard.
2.  **Direct Access (Authenticated)**: A logged-in user navigating to the base URL or `/dashboard` directly will see the dashboard.
3.  **Direct Access (Unauthenticated)**: An unauthenticated user attempting to access `/dashboard` directly will be redirected to the login screen.

## 3. UI States & Copy

### 3.1. Login Screen
**Intent**: Provide a clear, single path to access, minimizing cognitive load for technically competent users.

#### Default State
*   **Title**: "Welcome to [App Name]"
*   **Body Text (Optional)**: "Please sign in to continue."
*   **Button**: "Sign in with Google"

#### Signing In State
*   **Button**: "Signing in..." (with an inline spinner if possible, otherwise just text change).
    *   *Rationale*: Provides immediate feedback that the action has been registered.

#### Error State
*   **Error Message**: "Login failed. Please try again." (Displayed prominently below the button or as a temporary toast notification).
*   **Button**: Remains "Sign in with Google", allowing for retry.
*   **Specific Errors**: For network issues, "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."

### 3.2. Dashboard Screen
**Intent**: Serve as a clear, immediate entry point post-login, indicating readiness for future feature integration.

#### Default State
*   **Header**: "Dashboard"
*   **Welcome Message**: "Welcome, [User Name]!" (If user name is available from OAuth, otherwise "Welcome!")
*   **Content Area**: Placeholder for future modules.
    *   **Example Mock Card 1**: 
        *   **Title**: "Your Overview"
        *   **Body**: "This is a foundational space for your key information and quick actions. More features coming soon!"
    *   **Example Mock Card 2**: 
        *   **Title**: "Recent Activity"
        *   **Body**: "No recent activity to display yet." (Could use a `shadcn/ui` Skeleton component for a brief moment if actual content loading was implemented later).

## 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases
*   **Google OAuth Failure**: If Google authentication fails (e.g., user cancels, invalid credentials), the user is returned to the login screen with an appropriate error message.
*   **Network Interruption**: During login or dashboard load, network errors should be gracefully handled, typically by displaying a user-friendly error message and prompting a retry.
*   **Session Expiration**: If a user's session expires, any attempt to access authenticated routes should redirect them to the login screen.
*   **Unauthorized Access**: Direct navigation to authenticated routes (`/dashboard`) by an unauthenticated user will trigger a redirect to the login screen. This prevents access to unprivileged content and ensures the user flow starts correctly.

## 5. Design System Integration & UI Principles
*   All UI elements (buttons, typography, spacing, colors) will adhere to the `shadcn/ui` framework for consistency and a modern aesthetic.
*   **Clarity**: The UI should clearly communicate its purpose and the next predictable action.
*   **Simplicity**: Avoid unnecessary elements or complex layouts, especially on the foundational screens.
*   **Responsiveness**: The design should be inherently responsive, adapting gracefully to common mobile and desktop viewport sizes using `shadcn/ui`'s responsive utilities.
