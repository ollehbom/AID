# Design Specification: Initial User Interface (Feature ID: foundational-ui-mvp)

## 1. Complete User Flow

**Goal:** User successfully logs in via Google and views a mock dashboard.

1.  **Access Application:** User navigates to the product's URL.
2.  **Initial Load:** The application loads, displaying a global loading indicator.
3.  **Authentication Check:** The system checks for an existing, valid user session.
    *   **IF** valid session exists: Redirect to Dashboard.
    *   **ELSE** (no valid session): Display Login Screen.
4.  **Login Screen Interaction:** User clicks "Sign in with Google" button.
5.  **Google Authentication:** The user is redirected to the Google authentication flow (via popup or redirect).
6.  **Authentication Result:**
    *   **IF** Google authentication is successful: User is redirected back to the application.
    *   **IF** Google authentication fails or is cancelled: User is returned to the Login Screen with an error message.
7.  **Dashboard Load:** Upon successful authentication, the application displays a dashboard loading indicator.
8.  **Dashboard Display:** The mock dashboard content is rendered.

## 3. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Network Disconnection:**
    *   **Scenario:** User loses internet connection during initial app load or API calls.
    *   **Handling:** Display a global `shadcn/ui Toast` notification: "Network error. Please check your internet connection."
*   **Google Authentication Failure:**
    *   **Scenario:** Google login process fails (e.g., user denies permissions, network issue with Google, Google API error).
    *   **Handling:** Redirect to Login Screen with specific error message as described in 2.2.
*   **Backend API Failure (Dashboard Data):**
    *   **Scenario:** The API call to fetch dashboard data fails.
    *   **Handling:** Display the "Dashboard Data Load Error" state as described in 2.3, providing a "Refresh" button to retry the API call.
*   **Invalid/Expired Session:**
    *   **Scenario:** User's authenticated session expires while they are on the dashboard or tries to access a protected route directly without a valid session.
    *   **Handling:** Redirect to the Login Screen with the "Session Expired" message as described in 2.2.

## 4. Transitions and Animations

*   **Loading Indicators:** Use `shadcn/ui` spinner components for all loading states. Spinners should be fluid and not jumpy.
*   **Screen Transitions:** Subtle fade-in/fade-out animations for full-screen transitions (e.g., Login to Dashboard).
*   **Button Interactions:** Standard `shadcn/ui` button hover, focus, and active states. Disabled buttons should have a distinct visual style.
*   **Toast Notifications:** `shadcn/ui Toast` components should slide in from the top-right and automatically dismiss after a few seconds, or be dismissible by the user.
