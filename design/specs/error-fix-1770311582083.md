## Design Specification for Feature: Foundational UI (error-fix-1770311582083)

### 1. User Flow

The primary user flow involves a new or unauthenticated user accessing the application, authenticating via Google, and then being directed to a basic dashboard.

**Flow A: First-time / Unauthenticated User Access**
1.  **User navigates to application URL.**
2.  **System checks authentication status.**
    *   IF unauthenticated: **Display Login Screen.**
    *   IF authenticated: **Redirect to Dashboard.**

**Flow B: Google Login Process**
1.  **User is on Login Screen.**
2.  **User clicks "Sign in with Google" button.**
3.  **System initiates Google OAuth flow.**
    *   User is redirected to Google's authentication page (or a popup appears).
    *   User grants permissions to the application.
4.  **Google redirects back to the application with an authorization code/token.**
5.  **Application processes the authorization.**
    *   IF successful: **User is authenticated, redirect to Dashboard.**
    *   IF unsuccessful: **Display Login Screen with error message.**

**Flow C: Dashboard Access**
1.  **Authenticated user lands on Dashboard.**
2.  **Dashboard loads and displays core content.**

### 2. States

##### Login Screen
*   **Initial State**: Displays the "Welcome" message and "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Loading State (during Google Auth)**: After clicking "Sign in with Google", the button will show a loading spinner.
*   **Error State**: If Google authentication fails (e.g., user denies access, network issue, backend processing error), an error message is displayed on the Login Screen.
*   **Success State**: Brief intermediate state before navigating to the Dashboard.

##### Dashboard
*   **Loading State**: Upon initial load or data refresh, a central spinner or skeleton loader is displayed.
*   **Empty State**: If there's no data to display (e.g., no mock content configured), a friendly message indicating no content.
*   **Content Display State**: Displays the basic dashboard layout with mock content (e.g., a welcome message, a placeholder card).
*   **Error State (Data Fetching)**: If dashboard data fails to load, a message indicating the error.

### 3. Copy/Microcopy

##### Login Screen
*   **Header**: "Welcome to [Product Name]" (or simply "Welcome")
*   **Button**: "Sign in with Google"
*   **Error Message (Generic)**: "Could not sign in with Google. Please try again."
*   **Error Message (Specific - if possible)**: "Authentication failed. Please check your network connection or try again."
*   **Success Message (Toast)**: "Login successful! Redirecting to dashboard..."

##### Dashboard
*   **Header**: "Dashboard"
*   **Welcome Message**: "Welcome, [User Name]!" (where [User Name] is retrieved from Google profile)
*   **Placeholder Card Title**: "Your Insights at a Glance"
*   **Placeholder Card Content**: "This is your personalized dashboard. More features coming soon!"
*   **Empty State Message**: "Nothing to see here yet. We're busy preparing your insights!"
*   **Error Message (Data Fetching)**: "Failed to load dashboard content. Please refresh or try again later."

### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Authentication Failure**:
    *   **User Denial**: Display "Sign-in cancelled or denied. Please try again." on the login screen.
    *   **Network Issues (Client/Server)**: Display a generic "Network error. Please try again." or specific "Authentication failed. Please check your network connection." message on the login screen.
    *   **Backend Processing Error**: Display an appropriate error message returned from the backend on the login screen.
*   **Session Expiration/Invalidation**: Authenticated users with an expired/invalid session should be redirected to the Login Screen.
*   **Dashboard Data Loading Errors**:
    *   **Network/API Failure**: Display an error message on the dashboard, potentially with a "Retry" button.
*   **No User Name**: If the Google profile doesn't provide a display name, default to "Welcome!" or "Welcome, User!".

### 5. Transitions and Animations

*   **Login Button Click**: Subtle loading spinner within the "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Page Transitions**: Standard browser-level redirects. No complex custom page transitions are required initially.
*   **Dashboard Loading**: A simple, centrally aligned spinner component (Shadcn `Spinner` or similar) or skeleton loading states for dashboard cards/content.
*   **Toasts/Notifications**: Use Shadcn's `Toast` component for temporary success or error notifications.
