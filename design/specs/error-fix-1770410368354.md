### 1. User Flow: Initial Application Access & Dashboard

#### 1.1. Application Launch & Authentication Check
*   **Step 1: User navigates to the application URL.** The browser loads the initial application bundle.
*   **Step 2: Application loads.** A minimal, fast-loading splash screen or skeleton layout is displayed during initial asset loading.
*   **Step 3: Application checks for an active user session.** This involves checking local storage for a valid token or pinging a backend endpoint to validate session status.

#### 1.2. Unauthenticated User Flow (Google Login)
*   **Step 4 (Unauthenticated): Display Login Screen.** If no active session is found, the user is presented with the dedicated login screen.
*   **Step 5: User initiates Google Sign-in.** The user clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Step 6: Google authentication flow.** A Google authentication pop-up or redirect is initiated. The user completes the Google consent and authentication process.
*   **Step 7: Backend token verification.** Upon successful Google authentication, the obtained token is sent to the backend for verification and session creation (e.g., JWT issuance).
*   **Step 8: Redirect to Dashboard.** Upon successful backend verification and session establishment, the user is redirected to the main Dashboard screen.

#### 1.3. Authenticated User Flow (Dashboard Access)
*   **Step 4 (Authenticated): Redirect to Dashboard.** If an active, valid session is detected, the user is immediately redirected to the Dashboard screen.
*   **Step 5: Dashboard loads and fetches initial data.** The Dashboard UI renders, and concurrent API calls are made to populate any initial content.
*   **Step 6: Dashboard displays content.** Once data is loaded, the dashboard populates with relevant information.

### 2. States and Microcopy

#### 2.1. Initial Application Load
*   **State:** `Loading (App Initialization)`
    *   **UI:** Full-screen, centered spinner (Shadcn UI `Spinner` or similar) or a subtle skeleton layout of the main app frame.
    *   **Copy:** (No explicit copy needed; visual loading is sufficient for speed.)

#### 2.2. Google Login Screen
*   **State:** `Default (Unauthenticated)`
    *   **UI:** Centered `Card` component (Shadcn UI) with minimal branding. Contains a prominent "Sign in with Google" `Button`.
    *   **Copy (Header):** "Welcome to [Your App Name]"
    *   **Copy (Subheader):** "Please sign in to continue using your Google account."
    *   **Copy (Button):** "Sign in with Google"
*   **State:** `Loading (Google Auth in Progress)`
    *   **UI:** The "Sign in with Google" button is disabled and displays an inline spinner or changes text to indicate progress. Card remains visible.
    *   **Copy (Button):** "Signing in..."
*   **State:** `Error (Authentication Failed)`
    *   **UI:** An `Alert` or `Toast` component (Shadcn UI) with `destructive` variant displayed below the "Sign in with Google" button. The button is re-enabled.
    *   **Copy (Alert Title):** "Authentication Failed"
    *   **Copy (Alert Description):** "Could not sign in with Google. Please try again. If the problem persists, contact support."
*   **State:** `Success (Post-Authentication, Pre-Redirect)`
    *   **UI:** A temporary `Toast` or `Alert` component with `success` variant, followed by immediate redirect.
    *   **Copy (Toast/Alert):** "Successfully signed in. Redirecting to your dashboard..."

#### 2.3. Dashboard Screen
*   **State:** `Loading (Dashboard Data)`
    *   **UI:** Basic dashboard layout (header, sidebar if applicable) with skeleton loaders (Shadcn UI `Skeleton`) for all primary content areas.
    *   **Copy (Header):** "Dashboard"
    *   **Copy (Subheader/Placeholder):** "Loading your content..."
*   **State:** `Default (Content Loaded)`
    *   **UI:** A well-structured dashboard displaying a welcome message and placeholder sections for future features. Use `Card` components for content blocks.
    *   **Copy (Header):** "Dashboard"
    *   **Copy (Welcome Card Title):** "Hello, [User's First Name]!"
    *   **Copy (Welcome Card Body):** "Welcome to your central hub. This is where you'll find all your key information and actions. More features are coming soon!"
*   **State:** `Empty (No Content Yet)`
    *   **UI:** Dashboard layout with a central `Alert` or `Card` indicating no content, possibly with an illustrative icon.
    *   **Copy (Header):** "Dashboard"
    *   **Copy (Message Title):** "Your Dashboard is Quiet"
    *   **Copy (Message Body):** "It looks like there's no content to display here yet. As you start using the app, your insights and data will appear here."
*   **State:** `Error (Dashboard Data Load Failed)`
    *   **UI:** An `Alert` component with `destructive` variant displayed prominently within the main dashboard content area. Includes a "Retry" `Button`.
    *   **Copy (Header):** "Dashboard"
    *   **Copy (Alert Title):** "Failed to Load Dashboard"
    *   **Copy (Alert Description):** "We couldn't retrieve your dashboard content. Please check your internet connection and try again."
    *   **Copy (Button):** "Retry"

### 3. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Auth Failure:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Catch errors from the Google authentication client (e.g., user cancels, network issues during Google's flow) and backend verification failures.
    *   **UI Feedback:** Display the `Error (Authentication Failed)` state on the login screen.
    *   **Action:** User can click "Sign in with Google" to retry.
*   **Network Issues (Backend API Calls):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Implement robust error handling (try/catch, Axios interceptors) for all API requests (token verification, dashboard data).
    *   **UI Feedback:** Display specific `Error` states (e.g., `Error (Authentication Failed)`, `Error (Dashboard Data Load Failed)`).
    *   **Action:** Provide retry mechanisms where appropriate (e.g., "Retry" button on dashboard error).
*   **Session Expiration/Invalidation:**
    *   **Mechanism:** If any authenticated API call returns a 401 Unauthorized status, the application should clear the local session and automatically redirect the user to the login screen.
    *   **UI Feedback (on login screen):** (Optional `Toast` or `Alert` on redirect) "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."
*   **Browser/Device Compatibility:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Ensure Shadcn UI components are responsive and function across modern browsers and common device sizes (mobile-first approach).
    *   **UI Feedback:** (Not explicitly handled by UI, but design consideration).

### 4. Transitions and Animations

*   **Loading States:** Subtle fade-in/fade-out or slide-in/out for skeleton loaders and spinners to avoid jarring transitions. (e.g., `animate-fade-in` from Tailwind/Shadcn).
*   **Page Transitions:** For initial MVP, rely on standard browser navigation for full page redirects. For in-page component changes, use quick and subtle CSS transitions (e.g., `transition-opacity`, `transition-transform`).
*   **Button States:** Implement standard hover, focus, active, and disabled states for all interactive elements using Shadcn UI's default styling.
*   **Error/Success Messages:** Use subtle slide-down or fade-in animations for `Alert` and `Toast` components to draw attention without being distracting.
