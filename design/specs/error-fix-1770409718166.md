# Design Specification: Foundational UI (Login & Dashboard)

## Feature: Foundational UI - Login and Dashboard

### 1. Complete User Flow

**A. Login Flow**
1.  **User Arrives**: A new or logged-out user navigates to the application's root URL.
2.  **Login Screen Display**: The application presents the Login Screen.
3.  **Initiate Authentication**: The user clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
4.  **Google Authentication**: The browser redirects to Google's OAuth consent screen (or uses a pop-up, depending on implementation details).
5.  **Authentication Result**: 
    *   **Success**: Upon successful authentication with Google, the user is redirected back to the application.
    *   **Failure**: If Google authentication fails (e.g., user cancels, network error), the user is redirected back to the Login Screen with an error message.
6.  **Dashboard Access**: Upon successful application-level authentication (after Google's OAuth), the user is redirected to the Dashboard Screen.

**B. Dashboard Flow**
1.  **Dashboard Load**: The Dashboard Screen loads, displaying a welcome message and mock content.
2.  **Content Display**: The user views the initial set of information (e.g., recent activity cards).
3.  **Navigation (Future)**: (Out of scope for this spec, but intended for future features) The user would interact with dashboard elements to navigate to other parts of the application.

### 2. All Possible States

**A. Login Screen States**
*   **Initial State**: Displays the application welcome message and the "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Loading State**: (After button click, during Google OAuth redirect/process) A subtle loading indicator or a disabled button state, possibly with text like "Signing in..." to indicate activity.
*   **Error State**: (After failed Google authentication) Displays a clear error message on the Login Screen.

**B. Dashboard Screen States**
*   **Loading State**: (Immediately after successful login, before content is fully rendered) Displays a loading spinner or skeleton UI for the dashboard content.
*   **Content Display State**: Displays the dashboard header, welcome message, and mock content cards.
*   **Empty State**: (Hypothetical, for future actual content) If there were no data to display, it would show a message like "No recent activity yet." or "Your dashboard is empty. Get started by...". For this initial mock, we assume content is always present.

### 3. Exact Copy/Microcopy

**A. Login Screen**
*   **Header**: "Welcome to [App Name]"
*   **Call to Action Button**: "Sign in with Google"
*   **Loading Message (Optional)**: "Signing in..."
*   **Error Message**: "Authentication failed. Please try again."

**B. Dashboard Screen**
*   **Top Bar Title**: "Dashboard"
*   **Welcome Message**: "Welcome, [User Name]!"
*   **Section Title**: "Your Recent Activity"
*   **Mock Content Card Title 1**: "Project X Update"
*   **Mock Content Card Body 1**: "Successfully deployed new feature 'XYZ' to production environment."
*   **Mock Content Card Title 2**: "Meeting with Stakeholders"
*   **Mock Content Card Body 2**: "Discussed Q2 roadmap and upcoming priorities. Action items logged."
*   **Loading Message (Optional)**: "Loading your dashboard..."

### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Authentication Failure**: If Google's OAuth process fails or is cancelled by the user, the application should return to the Login Screen and display the error message: "Authentication failed. Please try again." This message should be dismissible or disappear after a short timeout.
*   **Network Issues**: If there are network issues during login or dashboard content loading, a generic, non-blocking message like "Network error. Please check your connection and try again." should be displayed, possibly with a refresh option.
*   **Unauthorized Access**: (Future consideration) If a logged-in user somehow tries to access unauthorized resources, they should be redirected to an appropriate error page or back to the dashboard with an 'Access Denied' message.

### 5. Transitions and Animations

*   **Login to Dashboard**: A standard page transition (e.g., fade-in or slide-in) to provide a smooth experience.
*   **Loading States**: Subtle loading spinners or skeleton loaders to indicate content is being fetched, preventing jarring empty screens.
*   **Error Message Display**: Error messages should appear smoothly (e.g., fade-in) and be clearly visible without obstructing critical UI elements.
