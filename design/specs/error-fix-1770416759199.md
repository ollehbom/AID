### Design Specification: Foundational Application Setup (Feature ID: error-fix-1770416759199)

#### 1. Overview
This specification details the user experience for the initial foundational build-out of the React application, focusing on the login flow via Google Authentication and the subsequent display of a basic dashboard. The design prioritizes clarity, speed, and adherence to established UI patterns, reinforcing the product belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation."

#### 2. User Flow: Google Login & Dashboard Access

**A. Initial Access / Login Page**
1.  **User Action**: User navigates to the application URL.
2.  **System Response**: The application displays a dedicated login page.
3.  **UI Elements**:
    *   **Header**: "Welcome to [App Name]" or "Sign In"
    *   **Call to Action**: A prominent button for Google Sign-In.
    *   **Optional Microcopy**: "Your journey starts here." or "Log in with your Google account to continue."

**B. Google Authentication**
1.  **User Action**: User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
2.  **System Response (Loading State)**:
    *   The button changes to a loading state (e.g., spinner within the button, disabled state).
    *   **Microcopy**: "Signing in..."
    *   A Google authentication pop-up or redirect is initiated.
3.  **User Action (Google Prompt)**: User selects their Google account and grants necessary permissions.

**C. Post-Authentication Redirect / Dashboard Access**
1.  **System Response (Success)**:
    *   Upon successful authentication, the Google pop-up closes (or redirect completes).
    *   The application immediately redirects the user to the main dashboard.
    *   No explicit "Success" message is shown on the login page; the redirection itself signals success.
2.  **UI Elements (Dashboard)**:
    *   **Header**: "Dashboard" or "Welcome, [User Name]" (if user data is available).
    *   **Content**: Basic mock content displayed within Shadcn Card components.
        *   Example Card 1: "Your Journey Begins" with placeholder text.
        *   Example Card 2: "Quick Actions" with placeholder links.
    *   **Navigation (Future)**: Placeholder for future navigation elements (e.g., sidebar, top nav).

#### 3. States

*   **Login Page - Initial**:
    *   Visible: "Welcome to [App Name]", "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   Button State: Enabled.
*   **Login Page - Loading (during Google Auth)**:
    *   Visible: "Signing in with Google..." (button text/state change), Google auth pop-up/redirect.
    *   Button State: Disabled, showing spinner.
*   **Login Page - Error (Google Auth Failed)**:
    *   Visible: "Welcome to [App Name]", "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   Error Message: A temporary, dismissible toast or inline message.
    *   **Copy**: "Login failed. Please try again." or "An error occurred during Google authentication. Please try again."
    *   Button State: Enabled again.
*   **Dashboard - Initial**:
    *   Visible: Dashboard header, mock content cards.
    *   No loading state assumed for initial mock content; it should render immediately post-login.

#### 4. Copy/Microcopy

*   **Login Page Header**: "Welcome to [App Name]"
*   **Login Button (Initial)**: "Sign in with Google"
*   **Login Button (Loading)**: "Signing in..."
*   **Login Error Message**: "Login failed. Please try again." or "An error occurred during Google authentication. Please try again."
*   **Dashboard Header**: "Dashboard"
*   **Mock Card Title 1**: "Your Journey Begins"
*   **Mock Card Body 1**: "This is your personalized dashboard. More features coming soon!"
*   **Mock Card Title 2**: "Quick Actions"
*   **Mock Card Body 2**: "Explore your settings or view recent activity."

#### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Google Authentication Failure**:
    *   If Google authentication fails (e.g., user cancels, network issue during Google's flow, API error), the user is returned to the login page.
    *   A clear, concise error message is displayed (e.g., "Login failed. Please try again.").
    *   The "Sign in with Google" button becomes re-enabled.
*   **Network Disconnection**:
    *   If the user's network connection drops during the Google authentication process, the Google pop-up/redirect will likely display its own network error.
    *   If the issue occurs during the app's internal redirect post-Google auth, a generic network error message should be displayed, and the user should be prompted to retry.
    *   **Copy**: "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."
*   **Unexpected Application Error**:
    *   For any unhandled errors during the login or dashboard rendering process, a generic, user-friendly error page or message should be displayed, prompting the user to refresh or contact support.

#### 6. Transitions and Animations

*   **Login Button**: Subtle hover and active states (provided by Shadcn UI).
*   **Page Transition (Login to Dashboard)**: A simple, fast fade or slide transition to enhance perceived speed and responsiveness. No complex animations are required at this foundational stage to align with "Users value speed over configurability."
