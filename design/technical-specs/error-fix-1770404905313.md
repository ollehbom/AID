# Technical Specification: Core UI Foundation (`error-fix-1770404905313`)

## Architecture Overview
The system will be built with a decoupled frontend and backend. The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, leveraging `shadcn/ui` for its component library. It will be hosted as static assets on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for optimal performance and scalability. User authentication will be facilitated via Google OAuth. The frontend will initiate the Google OAuth flow, receive an ID token upon successful authentication, and then send this token to a dedicated backend service. The backend will validate the Google ID token and issue an application-specific JSON Web Token (JWT), which the frontend will use for subsequent authenticated API calls to access protected resources.

## Components

-   **Frontend Application (SPA)**:
    -   **Purpose**: Provides the user interface, handles user interactions, manages client-side routing, and orchestrates the authentication flow.
    -   **Technology Stack**: React, TypeScript, Vite (for fast development/bundling), Tailwind CSS, `shadcn/ui` (for UI components), `@react-oauth/google` (or similar library for Google OAuth integration).
    -   **Key Modules/Areas**:
        -   `AuthModule`: Manages Google OAuth initiation, token submission to the backend, and secure storage/management of the application's JWT.
        -   `UIMainLayout`: Defines the overarching application layout, including headers, navigation, and content areas.
        -   `LoginPage`: Renders the
