# Technical Specification: Frontend Foundation (error-fix-1770402428642)

## Architecture Overview
The frontend application will be a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React. It will utilize `shadcn/ui` components styled with Tailwind CSS for a consistent and modern user interface. Authentication will be handled via Google OAuth, with the frontend initiating the OAuth flow and a dedicated backend service validating the Google ID token and issuing application-specific session tokens (e.g., JWTs). The application will be deployed as static assets to a CDN for high availability and performance.

    E -- "ID Token (securely)" --> F[Backend Auth Service];
    F -- "App Session Token (JWT)" --> E;
    E --> G{Dashboard (Protected Route)};
    G -- "API Requests (with JWT)" --> H[Backend API Services];
    H -- "Data" --> G;
    G -- "Logout" --> F;
    F -- "Clear Session" --> C;

## Components

-   **`App` (Root Component)**:
    -   Manages global state (e.g., authentication status, user info).
    -   Defines main routing (`react-router-dom`).
    -   Wraps application with necessary providers (e.g., AuthProvider, ThemeProvider).
-   **`AuthLayout`**:
    -   Container for the login screen.
    -   Ensures unauthenticated users are directed here.
-   **`DashboardLayout`**:
    -   Container for authenticated routes.
    -   Includes global elements like `Header` (with user info and logout) and potentially a `Sidebar`.
    -   Implements route protection.
-   **`LoginScreen`**:
    -   Displays
