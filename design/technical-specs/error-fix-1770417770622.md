# Technical Specification: Foundational UI Development (error-fix-1770417770622)

## Architecture Overview
The foundational UI will be built as a Next.js application, primarily employing Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for dynamic content. Styling will be managed through shadcn/ui, which leverages Tailwind CSS. Authentication will use Google OAuth 2.0's client-side flow, with critical token validation and session management handled by a dedicated backend service. The frontend application will be deployed as static assets via a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

## Components
-   **`app/layout.tsx`**: Global layout, shared UI elements (e.g., header, footer, navigation), and error boundaries.
-   **`app/login/page.tsx`**: Presents the Google Sign-In button, handles initial OAuth redirection, and displays loading/error states specific to the login process.
-   **`app/dashboard/page.tsx`**: The main user dashboard, displaying a welcome message, placeholder content, and handling data loading/error states.
-   **`components/ui/*`**: Re-export of shadcn/ui components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Spinner`, `Toast`).
-   **`lib/auth.ts`**: Client-side utility for initiating Google OAuth flow and handling token exchange with the backend.
-   **`context/AuthContext.tsx`**: React Context for managing and providing authentication state (user info, login status) across the application.
-   **`hooks/useAuth.ts`**: Custom hook for consuming `AuthContext` and providing authentication-related functions.

## Data Models
(Frontend perspective; backend will have more comprehensive models)

```typescript
// Represents a successfully authenticated user
interface User {
  id: string; // Unique identifier from backend
  name: string; // User's full name
  email: string; // User's email address
  avatarUrl?: string; // Optional URL to user's profile picture
}

// Structure for the ID Token received from Google
// (This is primarily handled by client-side OAuth libraries)
interface GoogleIdToken {
  iss: string;
  azp: string;
  aud: string;
  sub: string;
  email: string;
  email_verified: boolean;
  // ... other standard JWT claims
}

// Backend-issued session token (e.g., JWT) - typically stored in HTTP-only cookie
// and not directly accessible or modeled on the frontend beyond its presence.
```

## APIs

### 1. Client-Side Google OAuth Flow (Directly with Google)
-   **Endpoint**: Google's OAuth 2.0 endpoints (e.g., `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth`)
-   **Method**: `GET` (for redirection), `POST` (for token exchange, typically handled by client library)
-   **Description**: The frontend initiates the OAuth flow, redirects the user to Google for authentication and consent, and receives an authorization code or ID token back via a redirect URI.

### 2. Backend API: Google ID Token Validation & Session Creation
-   **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/google` (example backend endpoint)
-   **Description**: The client sends the Google ID Token obtained from the OAuth flow to this backend endpoint for verification and to establish a server-side session.
-   **Request Format**: `application/json`
    ```json
    {
