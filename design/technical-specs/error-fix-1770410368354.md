# Technical Specification: Core Application Foundation

## Architecture Overview
The system's core foundation comprises a modern Single Page Application (SPA) frontend built with React and a lightweight backend service. The frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface using Shadcn UI components and initiating the Google authentication flow. The backend serves as a secure gateway for verifying Google-issued ID tokens and establishing a persistent, secure application session. All communication is secured via HTTPS.
