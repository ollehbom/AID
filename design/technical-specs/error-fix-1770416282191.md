# Technical Specification: Establish Foundational UI and Design System

## Architecture Overview
The application's frontend will be a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React, leveraging `shadcn/ui` for its design system. It will be served statically via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for high performance and scalability. User authentication will be handled via Google OAuth 2.0, with token validation and session management performed by a dedicated backend API. The basic dashboard will consume data from a backend API.

## Components
- **`App` (Root Component)**: Orchestrates routing and global context providers (e.g., AuthContext, ThemeContext).
- **`LoginScreen`**: Presents the "Sign in with Google" button. Manages local loading states and displays authentication errors. Utilizes `shadcn/ui` components for styling.
- **`DashboardScreen`**: The authenticated landing page. Displays a welcome message and placeholder content for future features. Handles loading states for dashboard data. Utilizes `shadcn/ui` components.
- **`AuthService`**: A client-side service responsible for initiating the Google OAuth flow, handling the redirect/popup, and communicating with the backend for token exchange and session management.
- **`DesignSystem` (shadcn/ui)**: The collection of UI components (Button, Card, Input, Typography, etc.) used throughout the application, ensuring consistency and accessibility.
- **`Router`**: Client-side routing (e.g., React Router DOM) to manage navigation between public (`/login`) and protected (`/dashboard`) routes.
- **`ErrorBoundaries`**: React error boundaries to gracefully handle rendering errors within components and prevent application crashes.

## Data Models
### Client-side Session Data (conceptual)
```json
{
  "isAuthenticated": "boolean",
  "user": {
    "id": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "name": "string"
  },
  "accessToken": "string" // Application-specific JWT/session token received from backend
}
```
Note: `accessToken` should be managed securely (e.g., HTTP-only cookies, or stored carefully in memory/local storage with short expiry and refresh mechanisms).

## APIs
### 1. Google OAuth Authentication Endpoint (Backend)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/google/callback`
- **Purpose**: Receives the Google ID Token from the frontend, validates it, and issues an application-specific session token (e.g., JWT).
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "idToken": "string" // Google ID Token from client-side authentication
  }
  ```
- **Response (Success - HTTP 200 OK)**:
  ```json
  {
    "accessToken": "string", // Application's session token (JWT)
    "user": {
      "id": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "picture": "string" // Optional: User's profile picture URL
    }
  }
  ```
- **Response (Failure - HTTP 401 Unauthorized / 400 Bad Request)**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "string",
    "message": "string"
  }
  ```
- **Authentication Requirements**: None on this endpoint itself, as it's the entry point for app authentication.

### 2. Dashboard Data Endpoint (Backend)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/dashboard`
- **Purpose**: Fetches initial data or summary information for the user's dashboard.
- **Request Parameters**: None for this basic version.
- **Request Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` (using the token obtained from `/api/auth/google/callback`)
- **Response (Success - HTTP 200 OK)**:
  ```json
  {
    "welcomeMessage": "string",
    "recentActivity": [], // Placeholder for future data
    "summaryMetrics": {} // Placeholder for future data
  }
  ```
- **Response (Failure - HTTP 401 Unauthorized / 500 Internal Server Error)**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "string",
    "message": "string"
  }
  ```
- **Authentication Requirements**: Requires a valid application `accessToken` in the `Authorization` header.

## Infrastructure
- **Static Hosting**: Cloud-based static site hosting service (e.g., AWS S3 + CloudFront, Vercel, Netlify) for serving the compiled React application assets.
- **CDN**: Integrated with static hosting for global content delivery, caching, and improved performance.
- **DNS Management**: Configuration of domain records to point to the static hosting service.
- **HTTPS**: Mandatory SSL/TLS certificate configuration (provided by CDN/hosting service) for all traffic.
- **(Implicit) Backend API Service**: Assumed to be deployed separately, handling Google ID token validation and providing dashboard data. This service must also be secured with HTTPS.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Using React Testing Library and Vitest/Jest for individual React components (e.g., `LoginScreen`, `DashboardScreen` visual rendering, state logic, event handling).
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the interaction between components and client-side services. This includes the full client-side login flow (mocking Google OAuth popup and backend API responses) and data fetching for the dashboard.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Using tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate a full user journey: navigating to the app, clicking "Sign in with Google", completing authentication (potentially using a test account or mocking the final callback), and verifying dashboard content.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Utilize Lighthouse CI in CI/CD pipelines to monitor key web vitals, bundle size, and overall performance metrics for regressions.
- **Accessibility (A11y) Tests**: Integrate automated a11y checks (e.g., axe-core) into unit/integration tests and perform manual audits to ensure compliance with WCAG standards (leveraging shadcn/ui's inherent accessibility).

## Deployment
- **Rollout Strategy**: Standard static site deployment. For updates, leverage CDN invalidation or versioned asset paths to ensure users always get the latest version. Blue/Green or Canary deployments can be managed at the CDN level for more complex scenarios.
- **Feature Flags**: Not strictly required for this foundational release, but can be integrated for future feature toggling and controlled rollouts of new UI elements.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**:
    - **Frontend Error Monitoring**: Integrate Sentry, LogRocket, or similar tools to capture and report client-side JavaScript errors.
    - **Performance Monitoring**: Utilize Real User Monitoring (RUM) tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Datadog RUM) to track actual user experience metrics like page load times and interaction latencies.
    - **Uptime Monitoring**: External monitoring services to ensure the static site is always accessible.
    - **Security Monitoring**: Monitor CDN logs for suspicious activity or DDoS attempts.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate the build, test, and deployment process (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Vercel/Netlify built-in CI) to ensure consistent and reliable releases.
