# Technical Specification: Foundational UI/UX (Google Login & Basic Dashboard)

## Architecture Overview
The system will implement a Single Page Application (SPA) using **React**, styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **`shadcn/ui`** components. User authentication will be handled via **Google OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Flow with PKCE)**. The frontend will communicate with a dedicated, lightweight **Authentication Backend** (likely serverless) for secure token exchange and session management. All static frontend assets will be served via a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**.

## Components

### Frontend Application (React SPA)
-   **Framework**: Next.js (for React, routing, potential SSR/SSG benefits)
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with `shadcn/ui` for a consistent design system.
-   **Core Components**:
    -   `_app.tsx`, `_document.tsx`: Next.js root components.
    -   `layout.tsx`: Defines the overall page layout (header, main content).
    -   `LoginScreen.tsx`: Displays the login UI, initiates Google OAuth flow.
    -   `DashboardPage.tsx`: The primary post-login view, displaying user-specific content.
    -   `Header.tsx`: Navigation bar, product logo, user avatar/menu (Sign Out, Settings).
    -   `AuthContext.tsx`: React Context for managing authentication state across the application.
    -   `AuthService.ts`: Client-side utility for handling OAuth redirects, token storage, and API calls to the Authentication Backend.
-   **UI Components**: `shadcn/ui` components such as Button, Input, Card, Alert, Skeleton, Spinner, DropdownMenu, etc., customized to the product's design language.

### Authentication Backend (Serverless)
-   A set of serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) responsible for:
    -   **OAuth Token Exchange**: Receiving the authorization code from Google and securely exchanging it for access and refresh tokens.
    -   **Session Management**: Creating and managing secure user sessions, typically by issuing HTTP-only, secure cookies to the client.
    -   **User Profile Management**: Storing minimal user information (e.g., Google ID, email, name) in a secure database.
    -   **Token Validation**: Validating session tokens/cookies for protected API endpoints.

## Data Models

### Client-side `User` Object
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string; // Unique internal user ID
  googleId: string; // Google's unique user ID
  name: string; // User's display name
  email: string; // User's email address
  avatarUrl?: string; // URL to user's profile picture
}
```

### Backend `Session` Management
(Typically not exposed directly to client, managed via secure cookies/tokens)
-   `sessionId`: Unique identifier for the session.
-   `userId`: Links to the internal User record.
-   `expiresAt`: Timestamp for session expiration.
-   `createdAt`: Timestamp for session creation.
-   `ipAddress`: IP address of client when session was created (for security).
-   `userAgent`: User agent string (for security).
