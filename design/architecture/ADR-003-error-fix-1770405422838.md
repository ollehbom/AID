# ADR-003: Foundational React Frontend with Shadcn and Google OAuth

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our current development process lacks a consistent, scalable, and modern UI foundation, leading to slow feature development, inconsistent user experiences, and accumulated technical debt. This initiative aims to establish a robust frontend application to accelerate future product development and ensure a high-quality, standardized user experience.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: The chosen architecture must serve as a scalable foundation capable of supporting a growing user base (initially 1K-100K, with potential for >100K). Frontend assets should be globally accessible and performant.
-   **Team expertise**: We assume existing team proficiency with React and modern frontend development practices. The chosen technologies should leverage or enhance this expertise.
-   **Budget**: Frontend hosting should be cost-efficient, favoring static site hosting and CDN usage.
-   **Primary concerns**: Accelerating developer velocity, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience, maintaining strong security for authentication, and establishing a highly maintainable codebase.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React with shadcn/ui (Chosen)
**Pros:**
-   Provides a modern, unstyled component library built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, offering high customizability and composability.
-   Enhances developer velocity by providing ready-to-use, accessible components that can be easily themed.
-   Leverages an industry-standard framework (React) and styling approach (Tailwind CSS).
-   Strong community support and excellent documentation.
-   Promotes consistency and adherence to design system principles.

**Cons:**
-   Requires initial setup and configuration of Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives.
-   Potential learning curve for developers new to `shadcn/ui` or Tailwind CSS.
-   Requires disciplined usage to prevent UI inconsistencies if not properly managed.

### Option 2: React with a comprehensive UI library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design)
**Pros:**
-   Mature and extensive component sets, often with built-in theming solutions.
-   Can offer a faster start due to opinionated defaults.

**Cons:**
-   Often more opinionated and less flexible for deep customization compared to `shadcn/ui`'s headless approach.
-   Can lead to larger bundle sizes due to including more components than necessary.
-   May impose a specific design aesthetic that could conflict with desired brand identity.

### Option 3: Vanilla JavaScript/CSS or a custom UI framework
**Pros:**
-   Maximum control over every aspect of the UI and user experience.

**Cons:**
-   Significantly slower development time due to building everything from scratch.
-   High maintenance burden and increased risk of inconsistencies and technical debt.
-   Lacks community support and established best practices for component development.

## Decision
We will implement the foundational frontend application using **React with `shadcn/ui` for the component library and Google OAuth for user authentication**. This approach leverages a modern, flexible, and performant stack to establish a robust and consistent UI foundation.

## Rationale
`shadcn/ui` provides the ideal balance of speed and customizability, allowing us to quickly build a modern, accessible UI while maintaining full control over the aesthetic and behavior. React is a well-established and performant framework that our team is familiar with. Google OAuth offers a secure, reliable, and user-friendly authentication mechanism, offloading the complexities of identity management. This combination directly addresses our primary concerns of accelerating developer velocity, ensuring a consistent user experience, and providing a secure authentication flow, setting a strong precedent for all future frontend development.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   **Accelerated Development**: Future UI feature development will be significantly faster due to a standardized, reusable component library.
-   **Consistent User Experience**: `shadcn/ui` enforces design system principles, leading to a unified and intuitive user interface across the application.
-   **Modern & Performant UI**: Leverages React's performance characteristics and `shadcn/ui`'s optimized components.
-   **Enhanced Security**: Google OAuth provides robust, industry-standard authentication.
-   **Improved Maintainability**: Standardized components and clear project structure will reduce technical debt.

**Negative:**
-   **Initial Setup Overhead**: Integrating `shadcn/ui` and configuring Tailwind CSS requires an upfront time investment.
-   **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with `shadcn/ui`, Radix UI, or Tailwind CSS will require time to adapt.

**Risks:**
-   **Inconsistent Customization**: Without strict guidelines, developers might over-customize `shadcn/ui` components, leading to UI inconsistencies. Mitigation: Strong code reviews, comprehensive documentation, and potentially Storybook for component cataloging.
-   **Security Misconfiguration**: Incorrect implementation of Google OAuth (e.g., improper token handling, lack of server-side validation) could introduce vulnerabilities. Mitigation: Adhere to best practices for OAuth, ensure all tokens are validated on the backend, and use secure session management (e.g., HTTP-only cookies).
-   **Performance Degradation**: Large bundle sizes or inefficient component rendering could negatively impact initial load times and overall performance. Mitigation: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and follow React performance best practices.

## Implementation Guidance
-   **Project Setup**: Initialize the React application using a modern bundler like Vite for optimal development experience and build performance.
-   **`shadcn/ui` Integration**: Follow the official `shadcn/ui` installation guide, ensuring Tailwind CSS is correctly configured for theming and utility-first styling.
-   **Google OAuth**: Use a well-supported client-side library (e.g., `@react-oauth/google`) to initiate the OAuth flow. Crucially, ensure the backend is responsible for validating the `idToken` received from Google and creating secure user sessions (e.g., using HTTP-only, secure cookies).
-   **Accessibility (A11y)**: Prioritize accessibility from the outset, leveraging `shadcn/ui`'s built-in accessibility features and adhering to WCAG guidelines.
-   **Error Handling**: Implement robust client-side error boundaries for React components and utilize `shadcn/ui`'s Toast or AlertDialog components for user-facing error notifications.
-   **Loading States**: Incorporate `shadcn/ui`'s skeleton loaders or spinners for all asynchronous data fetching and page transitions to provide clear user feedback.
-   **Routing**: Implement client-side routing (e.g., React Router DOM) to manage navigation between the login and dashboard screens.
-   **Component Structure**: Organize components logically, distinguishing between layout components, UI components, and feature-specific components.
