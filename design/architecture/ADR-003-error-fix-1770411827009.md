# ADR-003: Foundational React App & Design System (error-fix-1770411827009)

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This architectural decision addresses the need to establish a foundational React application, integrating `shadcn/ui` for a consistent design system, implementing Google authentication, and providing a basic dashboard. This serves as the initial interactive user interface for the product, moving beyond a non-interactive state and enabling initial user engagement. It is critical for validating core product beliefs and providing a robust platform for future feature development.

## Decision Drivers
- **Scale:** The foundation must support growth from initial engagement towards 1K-100K users, requiring a scalable and performant frontend.
- **Team expertise:** The team is competent in modern web development, particularly React, and seeks to leverage modern tools for efficiency.
- **Budget:** The solution should be cost-effective for an initial MVP, favoring managed services and efficient resource utilization.
- **Primary concerns:**
  - **Security-First:** Robust and secure user authentication is paramount.
  - **Speed-First:** The UI must be fast, responsive, and intuitive to align with the belief that "Users value speed over configurability."
  - **Consistency:** A unified and extensible design system is required for rapid and consistent UI iteration.
  - **Reliability:** The application must handle errors gracefully and provide a stable user experience.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React with `shadcn/ui` (Chosen Approach)
**Pros:**
- Provides headless, composable UI components, offering maximum flexibility for custom styling while ensuring accessibility and functionality.
- Excellent for establishing a consistent and extensible design system from the outset, aligning with the
