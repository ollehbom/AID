# ADR-003: Foundational Frontend Architecture with React & Shadcn UI

## Status
Accepted

## Context
This Architecture Decision Record (ADR) addresses the critical need to establish a robust, modern, and consistent frontend architecture for the product. Currently, there is no existing frontend application or design system. The goal is to lay a foundational UI/UX layer that accelerates future feature development, ensures a cohesive user experience, and aligns with core product beliefs regarding intuitiveness and speed. This includes the setup of a React application, integration of Shadcn UI, implementation of Google login, and a basic dashboard.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: The initial user base will be small (<1K), but the architecture must efficiently support growth to 1K-100K users without significant refactoring.
-   **Team Expertise**: The development team (likely a founding engineer or small team) requires a framework that is well-documented, has a strong community, and allows for rapid iteration without excessive overhead.
-   **Budget**: Given a startup context, the hosting budget for the frontend is constrained, favoring cost-efficient static site hosting and client-side rendering.
-   **Primary Concerns**:
    -   **Rapid Development**: Need to quickly build and iterate on UI components.
    -   **Consistent UI/UX**: Essential for meeting product beliefs of 'obvious without documentation' and 'speed over configurability'.
    -   **Intuitive Onboarding**: The login experience must be seamless and secure.
    -   **Performance**: The application must be fast and responsive.
    -   **Security**: Authentication must be robust and secure.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React with Shadcn UI and Google Login (Chosen)
**Pros:**
-   **Modern & Performant**: React provides a component-based architecture for efficient UI rendering. Shadcn UI builds on Tailwind CSS and Radix UI, offering highly performant, accessible, and customizable components.
-   **Rapid Development**: Large ecosystem, extensive community support, and pre-built components from Shadcn significantly accelerate development cycles.
-   **Consistency**: Shadcn UI provides an opinionated and consistent design system, directly supporting the product's UI/UX beliefs.
-   **Secure Authentication**: Google Login (OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect) offers a familiar, secure, and low-friction authentication method, offloading significant security complexity.
-   **Scalable Hosting**: A client-side rendered React app can be hosted as static assets via a Content Delivery Network (CDN), offering high availability and low cost.

**Cons:**
-   **Initial Setup Overhead**: Integrating React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI requires some initial configuration and understanding.
-   **Learning Curve**: While popular, new team members unfamiliar with React/Tailwind might have a learning curve.
-   **Bundle Size**: Potential for larger JavaScript bundle size if not optimized, impacting initial load times.

### Option 2: Other SPA Framework (e.g., Vue.js, Angular)
**Pros:**
-   Mature ecosystems with similar benefits to React in terms of component-based development.
-   Vue.js is often cited for its ease of learning.

**Cons:**
-   May not align as strongly with the current perceived industry momentum for rapid startup development, or potential future talent pool.
-   Component libraries might offer different levels of customizability or integration ease compared to Shadcn UI.

### Option 3: Server-Side Rendered (SSR) Framework (e.g., Next.js, Remix)
**Pros:**
-   Better SEO and potentially faster initial page load (Time To First Byte) for content-heavy applications.
-   Simplified data fetching on the server.

**Cons:**
-   Increased server-side complexity and hosting costs, which might conflict with budget constraints.
-   Overkill for an interactive web application where much content is dynamic and often behind authentication, reducing the benefit of SSR for initial content delivery.
-   Adds a server dependency for every page request, rather than just API calls.

## Decision
We will implement the foundational frontend using **React with Shadcn UI components and integrate Google Login** for user authentication. The application will be client-side rendered and deployed as static assets.

## Rationale
This approach offers the best balance of rapid development, a modern and consistent user experience, strong performance characteristics, and robust security for authentication. React and Shadcn UI together provide a powerful and flexible toolkit for building high-quality UIs efficiently. Google Login simplifies the authentication process for both users and developers, leveraging a trusted third-party provider. Hosting as static assets via a CDN ensures high availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for the frontend.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   **Accelerated Development**: Leveraging React's component model and Shadcn's pre-built, customizable components will significantly speed up UI development.
-   **Consistent & High-Quality UI**: Shadcn UI ensures a consistent design language and accessible components, aligning with product beliefs.
-   **Secure & Intuitive Authentication**: Google Login provides a familiar and secure entry point for users.
-   **Cost-Efficient & Scalable Frontend**: Static asset hosting on a CDN minimizes infrastructure costs and scales effortlessly with user demand.
-   **Strong Ecosystem**: Access to a vast array of React libraries and community support.

**Negative:**
-   **Initial Setup Time**: Setting up the development environment, integrating Shadcn UI, and configuring build processes will require an initial time investment.
-   **Client-Side Security Concerns**: While Google handles core authentication, proper token management (e.g., secure storage, refresh cycles) on the client is crucial to prevent XSS/CSRF vulnerabilities.

**Risks:**
-   **Vendor Lock-in (Authentication)**: Over-reliance on Google Login might make switching authentication providers more complex in the future.
-   **Bundle Size Bloat**: Without careful optimization, the JavaScript bundle size could grow, impacting initial load times.
-   **State Management Complexity**: As the application grows, managing global state effectively will become critical to maintain performance and developer experience.

## Implementation Guidance
-   Use **React 18+ with TypeScript** for type safety and modern features.
-   Integrate **Shadcn UI** following their official documentation, ensuring consistent theming and component usage.
-   Implement **Google Login** using a secure OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect flow. For production, Google's authorization code flow with a backend for token exchange and session management is highly recommended over implicit flows.
-   Ensure **HTTPS** is enforced for all frontend and API communication.
-   Implement robust **client-side error handling** for API calls, network issues, and authentication failures, providing clear user feedback as per the Design Spec.
-   Prioritize **bundle size optimization** (e.g., code splitting, tree shaking) and **performance monitoring** (Web Vitals) from the outset.
-   Develop **unit tests** for individual components (using React Testing Library) and **integration tests** for critical user flows, especially the login process.
-   Utilize a **CDN** (e.g., CloudFront, Vercel, Netlify) for hosting static assets.
