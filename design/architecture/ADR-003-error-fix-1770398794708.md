# ADR-003: Initial UI/UX and Google Authentication Setup

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This Architecture Decision Record (ADR) addresses the foundational setup of the product's user interface and authentication system. The primary goal is to establish a modern, consistent UI/UX framework using React and shadcn, integrate Google login for seamless user access, and provide a basic dashboard for initial user engagement. This work is critical as it forms the base upon which all future features will be built, directly impacting user perception, developer velocity, and overall product usability.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Founder's Directive**: Establish core UI/UX with React, shadcn, Google login, and a basic dashboard.
-   **User Experience**: Achieve a modern, intuitive, and consistent UI/UX to ensure immediate product engagement and support the belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation."
-   **Rapid Development**: Provide a robust and standardized frontend framework to accelerate future feature development.
-   **Security**: Implement a secure and widely trusted authentication method (Google OAuth).
-   **Scalability**: Lay a foundation that can efficiently scale with increasing user numbers and feature complexity.
-   **Consistency**: Leverage a design system (shadcn) to ensure visual and interactive consistency across the application.
-   **Cost-Efficiency**: Opt for solutions that are cost-effective for initial setup and can scale efficiently.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React with Shadcn UI and Google OAuth (Chosen)
**Description**: Develop the frontend using React, integrate `shadcn/ui` for a modern and consistent design system, and implement Google OAuth for user authentication, managed through a minimal backend service for token validation and session management.

**Pros:**
-   **Modern & Component-Based**: React provides a highly efficient and maintainable component-based architecture.
-   **Consistent Design System**: Shadcn/ui offers a collection of accessible and customizable components built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, ensuring visual consistency and accelerating UI development.
-   **Trusted Authentication**: Google OAuth is a widely used, secure, and user-friendly authentication method, reducing friction for new users and offloading security complexities.
-   **Developer Velocity**: The combination enables rapid prototyping and development of new features.
-   **Scalability**: React applications can be highly optimized for performance, and static site hosting + serverless functions scale well.
-   **Cost-Effective**: Static hosting is generally inexpensive, and serverless functions for backend auth are cost-efficient at low to moderate scale.

**Cons:**
-   **Learning Curve**: New developers might need to adapt to React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn paradigms.
-   **Dependency Management**: Reliance on external libraries and Google's OAuth service means managing dependencies and potential breaking changes.
-   **Backend Requirement**: Even for basic auth, a minimal backend service is required for secure token exchange and session management, adding a small layer of infrastructure.

### Option 2: Frontend with a different UI framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Material UI) and custom email/password authentication
**Description**: Use an alternative UI framework for the frontend and implement a custom email/password authentication system.

**Pros:**
-   **Full Control (Custom Auth)**: Complete control over the authentication flow and user data.
-   **Variety of UI Frameworks**: Many established UI frameworks available.

**Cons:**
-   **Increased Security Burden**: Custom auth requires significant effort to implement securely (password hashing, MFA, session management, breach detection, etc.), increasing risk and development time.
-   **Slower User Onboarding**: Custom email/password can be more cumbersome for users than social logins.
-   **Potentially Less Modern Aesthetic**: Some older UI frameworks may not align with the desired modern, polished aesthetic.
-   **Higher Development Cost**: More effort in both UI customization and security implementation.

## Decision
We will proceed with **Option 1: React with Shadcn UI and Google OAuth**, utilizing static site hosting for the frontend and a minimal serverless backend for secure Google OAuth token exchange and session management. This approach provides the best balance of rapid development, modern user experience, robust security via a trusted provider, and cost-efficiency, while laying a strong foundation for future product growth.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   **Accelerated Feature Development**: Developers can quickly build new features on a consistent and well-documented UI framework.
-   **Enhanced User Experience**: Users will benefit from a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing interface with a frictionless login process.
-   **Strong Security Posture**: Leveraging Google OAuth delegates significant security responsibilities to a trusted provider, reducing internal security overhead.
-   **Scalable Frontend**: Static site hosting combined with CDN ensures high availability and performance for the UI.
-   **Clear Design Language**: Shadcn helps maintain design consistency, reducing design debt and improving brand identity.

**Negative:**
-   **Vendor Lock-in (Google OAuth)**: Strong dependency on Google for authentication. While common, a future pivot to other providers would require rework.
-   **Dependency Management**: Ongoing effort to keep React, Shadcn, and related libraries updated and manage potential breaking changes.
-   **Minimal Backend Overhead**: A small backend component is still required, adding a slight increase in operational complexity compared to a purely static site.

**Risks:**
-   **Google API Changes**: Changes in Google's OAuth API could require updates to our authentication implementation.
-   **Performance Degradation**: If not properly optimized, a React application can suffer from performance issues, especially with complex UIs or large bundles.
-   **Security Vulnerabilities**: While Google handles core OAuth security, our implementation of token handling and session management must be flawless to prevent vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).

## Implementation Guidance
-   **Frontend Framework**: Use React (via Vite or Create React App for initial setup).
-   **UI Library**: Integrate `shadcn/ui` components for all UI elements, customizing via Tailwind CSS.
-   **Authentication**: Implement Google OAuth 2.0. Use a client-side library (e.g., `@react-oauth/google` or similar) for the initial redirect, and a secure backend endpoint for token exchange and session creation.
-   **Backend for Auth**: A lightweight serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Function) should handle the OAuth callback, validate the Google ID token, create/retrieve user records (if applicable), and issue a secure session token (e.g., JWT) to the client.
-   **Session Management**: Store session tokens securely (e.g., HTTP-only, secure cookies) on the client side. Ensure token invalidation on logout and proper expiry.
-   **Routing**: Implement React Router for client-side navigation between landing page and dashboard.
-   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error boundaries and display user-friendly messages for authentication failures and general system errors as per design specs.
-   **Accessibility**: Ensure all Shadcn components are used and customized with accessibility best practices in mind.
-   **Deployment**: Deploy the React application as a static site to a CDN-backed hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3 + CloudFront). Deploy the auth backend as a serverless function.
-   **Security Best Practices**: Enforce HTTPS for all communication. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers. Validate all input on the backend. Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF).
-   **Monitoring**: Integrate frontend error tracking (e.g., Sentry) and backend logging/monitoring for authentication flows.
