# ADR-003: Foundational React Application with Shadcn UI and Google Login

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The objective is to establish the foundational build-out for a new React application. This includes integrating Shadcn UI for a modern aesthetic and rapid component development, implementing Google authentication for streamlined user access, and creating a basic dashboard as the initial user landing page. This foundation is critical for enabling future feature development and validating core product beliefs regarding intuitiveness and speed.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: Initial MVP targeting <1K users, but the architecture must be inherently scalable to support future growth (1K-100K+ users).
-   **Team expertise**: Assumed proficiency in React and modern frontend development practices. Leveraging established libraries and authentication providers reduces bespoke development effort.
-   **Budget**: Cost-effective hosting and managed services are preferred to optimize initial expenditure for an MVP.
-   **Primary concerns**: Rapid development velocity, intuitive user experience, robust security for authentication, and perceived performance (speed).

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React + Shadcn UI + Google Authentication (Chosen Approach)
**Pros:**
-   **Rapid Development**: Shadcn UI provides pre-built, accessible, and themeable components, significantly accelerating UI development.
-   **Modern UI/UX**: Aligns with contemporary design trends, contributing to an intuitive and visually appealing product.
-   **Secure & Familiar Authentication**: Google Authentication is widely adopted, trusted, and reduces the burden of managing user credentials directly.
-   **Scalability**: React applications are inherently scalable for frontend, and static hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) supports high traffic with ease.
-   **Maintainability**: Standardized components and well-documented libraries improve long-term maintainability.

**Cons:**
-   **Vendor Lock-in (Authentication)**: Reliance on Google for the primary authentication mechanism introduces a dependency.
-   **Learning Curve**: While React is common, some team members might need to adapt to Shadcn's specific integration pattern (e.g., CLI component generation).

### Option 2: React + Custom UI Library + Custom Authentication Solution
**Pros:**
-   **Full Control**: Complete customization over UI components and authentication logic.

**Cons:**
-   **High Development Effort**: Significant time and resources required to build and maintain a custom UI library and a secure authentication system from scratch.
-   **Increased Security Risk**: Custom authentication solutions often carry higher security risks if not implemented by security experts.
-   **Slower Time to Market**: Delays initial product launch due to extensive development.

### Option 3: Different Frontend Framework (e.g., Vue, Angular)
**Pros:**
-   Could be viable depending on team expertise and ecosystem preference.

**Cons:**
-   Divergence from assumed React expertise, potentially requiring retraining or new hires.
-   Might not offer the same level of component ecosystem maturity or development velocity as React + Shadcn for this specific use case.

## Decision
We will proceed with **React for the frontend framework, integrating Shadcn UI for component development, and utilizing Google Authentication for user login**. This approach balances rapid development, modern user experience, robust security, and scalability, providing a strong foundation for the product's evolution.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   Accelerated development of UI features due to a robust component library.
-   Consistent and professional user interface, enhancing user trust and adoption.
-   Secure and widely accepted authentication mechanism, reducing security implementation overhead.
-   Optimized initial cost through leveraging managed services for hosting and authentication.
-   High performance and reliability for the frontend via static hosting and CDN.

**Negative:**
-   Potential future challenges if Google's authentication policies or APIs change significantly.
-   Initial learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Shadcn UI's specific patterns.

**Risks:**
-   **Vendor Lock-in**: Over-reliance on Google for authentication might limit future flexibility for alternative identity providers.
-   **UI Inconsistency**: If design system principles are not strictly adhered to, the UI might diverge over time.
-   **Google API Rate Limits/Downtime**: Although rare, reliance on an external service carries inherent risks.

## Implementation Guidance
-   **Project Setup**: Initialize the React application using a modern toolchain like Vite or `create-react-app`.
-   **Shadcn UI Integration**: Follow Shadcn's official documentation for installation and component integration, leveraging its CLI for consistent component generation.
-   **Google Authentication**: Implement Google OAuth 2.0 flow using a battle-tested library such as `@react-oauth/google` for React. Ensure secure handling of `idToken` and `accessToken`.
-   **Security**: All frontend-to-backend communication (if applicable) and static asset serving MUST be over HTTPS. Implement secure client-side session management (e.g., storing tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` with appropriate expiry and refresh token mechanisms, or preferably, using HTTP-only cookies managed by a secure backend).
-   **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback for the login flow (e.g., failed authentication attempts, network issues).
-   **Accessibility**: Ensure all Shadcn components are used and customized with accessibility best practices in mind.
-   **Routing**: Use `react-router-dom` for client-side routing between the login page and the dashboard.
-   **Deployment**: Configure a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments to a static hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3/CloudFront).
