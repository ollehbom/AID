# ADR-003: Implement Foundational React App and Design System

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The product requires a modern, scalable, and consistent frontend application to serve as the foundation for all future features. Currently, there is no existing UI/UX framework, leading to potential inconsistencies, slow development cycles, and difficulty in conveying product value. This decision addresses the need to establish a robust application shell with a consistent design system, secure authentication, and a basic dashboard.

## Decision Drivers
- **Scale:** The architecture must support future user growth, from initial users to potentially 100K+ users.
- **Team expertise:** Leverage widely adopted and well-supported frontend technologies (React) to align with common developer skill sets and accelerate development.
- **Budget:** Minimize development costs and operational overhead for frontend hosting and maintenance.
- **Primary concerns:** Rapid feature development, consistent and intuitive user experience, robust security (especially authentication), and good performance.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Vanilla JavaScript / Custom Frontend Framework

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility and control over every aspect.

**Cons:**
- High initial development cost and ongoing maintenance.
- Significant effort required to build a consistent UI/UX from scratch.
- Slower development cycles for future features.
- Difficult to scale and maintain without a standardized approach.

### Option 2: Established Framework (React) + Custom CSS/Styling

**Pros:**
- Modern component-based development with a large ecosystem (React).
- Good performance characteristics.

**Cons:**
- Still requires substantial design and styling effort to achieve consistency.
- Slower initial setup compared to using a pre-built design system.
- Potential for UI inconsistencies if design guidelines are not strictly enforced.

### Option 3: Established Framework (React) + Design System (Shadcn UI) + Google OAuth

**Pros:**
- **Rapid Development:** Shadcn UI (built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS) provides headless, accessible components and a utility-first CSS framework, significantly accelerating UI development.
- **Consistent UI/UX:** Ensures a unified look and feel out of the box, reducing design debt and improving user experience.
- **Security:** Google OAuth offloads complex authentication mechanisms, providing a secure, widely accepted, and easy-to-integrate login solution.
- **Scalability:** React's component-based nature and static serving via CDN are highly scalable.
- **Maintainability:** Standardized components and clear separation of concerns enhance long-term maintainability.

**Cons:**
- Initial learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Shadcn UI or Tailwind CSS.
- Dependency on Google for authentication (vendor lock-in risk, though standard OAuth mitigates this).
- Potential for larger bundle sizes if not optimized (e.g., code splitting, tree shaking).

## Decision
We will implement the foundational frontend application using **React** with **Shadcn UI** for the design system and **Google OAuth** for user authentication.

## Rationale
This approach best balances the need for rapid development, a consistent user experience, and robust security, while laying a strong foundation for future scalability. React provides a modern, performant, and maintainable framework. Shadcn UI drastically reduces the effort required to build a professional and consistent user interface, aligning with the product's belief in an
