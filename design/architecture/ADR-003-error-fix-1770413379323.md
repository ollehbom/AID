# ADR-003: Foundational React UI with Google Login and shadcn/ui

## Status
Accepted

## Context
This decision outlines the architecture for establishing the product's initial user interface, focusing on a basic React application with Google login, a mock dashboard, and the implementation of a modern design system using shadcn/ui. This is a critical first step to enable user interaction, validate core product beliefs, and pave the way for subsequent feature development.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: The initial user base is expected to be small (<1K users), but the architecture must support future growth to 1K-100K users without significant refactoring.
-   **Team expertise**: Assumed proficiency in React and modern frontend development practices.
-   **Budget**: Standard cloud hosting costs, prioritizing efficiency for initial stages.
-   **Primary concerns**: Security of user authentication, performance of initial application load and responsiveness, reliability of core login and dashboard access, and ensuring a consistent, intuitive user experience.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Server-Side Rendered (SSR) React Framework (e.g., Next.js)

**Pros:**
-   Potentially faster perceived initial load times (Time To First Byte).
-   Better for SEO, which might be a future requirement.
-   Integrated full-stack capabilities.

**Cons:**
-   Increased hosting complexity and potentially higher compute costs (requires server-side rendering infrastructure).
-   Steeper learning curve if the team is primarily experienced with purely client-side React applications.
-   Overkill for a foundational UI with a mock dashboard and limited content.

### Option 2: Pure Client-Side Rendered (CSR) React Application (e.g., Vite/Create React App)

**Pros:**
-   Simpler deployment (static assets served via CDN), leading to lower hosting costs.
-   Faster development cycle for frontend-focused teams.
-   Excellent performance for interactive applications once loaded.
-   Well-suited for building Single Page Applications (SPAs).

**Cons:**
-   Slower initial load (full JavaScript bundle download) compared to SSR, potentially impacting perceived performance on slow networks.
-   Poorer SEO capabilities out-of-the-box (though can be mitigated with pre-rendering for specific pages if needed later).

## Decision
We will implement a **Client-Side Rendered (CSR) React Application** using a modern build tool (e.g., Vite) for fast development and optimized builds. The application will be deployed as static assets via a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Google Login will be implemented using the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**, mediated by a dedicated backend authentication service. All UI components will leverage **shadcn/ui** to ensure consistency and accelerate development.

## Rationale
-   **CSR React with CDN**: This approach aligns perfectly with the
