# ADR-003: Foundational UI and Google Login

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This Architecture Decision Record addresses the need to establish the foundational user interface and authentication mechanism for the product's Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The goal is to create a modern React application, styled with Shadcn UI, implement Google OAuth for user login, and provide a basic dashboard accessible post-authentication. This foundation is critical for enabling user interaction, validating core product beliefs, and supporting rapid iteration for future feature development.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: The initial MVP targets technically competent users (likely <1K), but the architecture must be designed to scale efficiently to support rapid growth (1K-100K users) without requiring significant re-platforming.
-   **Team expertise**: Assumed technical team proficiency in modern web development, specifically React, TypeScript, and component-based UI libraries.
-   **Budget**: Initial setup should be cost-efficient, leveraging managed cloud services and widely adopted open-source technologies to minimize operational overhead.
-   **Primary concerns**: Security of user authentication, rapid development velocity for UI, intuitive and modern user experience, and establishing a robust base for future features.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React with Shadcn UI and Dedicated Backend Authentication Service (Chosen)
**Pros:**
-   **Rapid UI Development**: Shadcn UI provides a collection of re-usable, accessible components that are easy to integrate and customize, accelerating frontend development.
-   **Modern Frontend**: React is a leading framework for building interactive user interfaces, offering a component-driven architecture and strong community support.
-   **Secure Authentication**: Google OAuth is a widely adopted, secure, and user-friendly authentication standard. A dedicated backend service ensures proper token validation, user management, and secure session handling, adhering to best practices like HttpOnly cookies for session tokens.
-   **Scalability**: Frontend as a Single Page Application (SPA) can be deployed on a CDN for high scalability and low latency. The backend authentication service can be independently scaled.
-   **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Distinct frontend and backend services promote modularity, maintainability, and allow for independent development and deployment.

**Cons:**
-   Requires development and maintenance of a separate backend authentication service, adding to initial infrastructure and development effort.
-   Frontend team needs proficiency in React, TypeScript, and familiarity with Shadcn UI's utility-first approach.

### Option 2: React with Alternative UI Library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design) and Integrated Backend Authentication
**Pros:**
-   Alternative UI libraries are mature and offer extensive component sets.
-   Backend authentication could be integrated directly into a monolith if the product scope was smaller or if a full-stack framework was preferred.

**Cons:**
-   Other UI libraries might be more opinionated, potentially limiting design flexibility compared to Shadcn's
