# ADR-003: Initial Application UI Foundation with Google Login

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The product currently lacks a foundational user interface, preventing any user interaction or validation of core product beliefs. This decision addresses the critical need to establish a secure, intuitive, and modern entry point into the application through Google login and a basic dashboard, thereby enabling initial user engagement and validating the belief that "the product must feel obvious without documentation."

## Decision Drivers
- **Scale**: The architecture must support anticipated growth from internal dogfooding to 1K-100K users, requiring scalable authentication and UI components.
- **Team expertise**: Leverage existing or easily acquired expertise in modern web technologies like React and standard cloud practices.
- **Budget**: Focus on cost-effective solutions for an MVP, utilizing managed cloud services to minimize operational overhead.
- **Primary concerns**: Security (robust user authentication), intuitiveness (seamless user experience), rapid development (accelerate feature delivery), and reliability (stable core functionality).

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Custom Authentication & Minimalist UI Library
**Pros:**
- Full control over the authentication flow and UI components.
- Reduced external dependencies.

**Cons:**
- High security risk due to custom authentication implementation (potential vulnerabilities).
- Significant development time and effort required for both authentication and UI design.
- UI might lack polish and consistency without a comprehensive design system.

### Option 2: React + Shadcn UI + Google OAuth (Chosen)
**Pros:**
- **Rapid Development**: Leveraging React for frontend and Shadcn UI for a pre-built, accessible, and modern design system accelerates UI development.
- **Robust Security**: Google OAuth provides a highly secure and widely trusted authentication mechanism, offloading significant security responsibilities.
- **Scalability**: React applications are inherently scalable, and Google OAuth is designed for massive scale. Backend services for authentication can be built using serverless functions for elastic scaling.
- **Consistency**: Shadcn UI ensures a consistent look and feel, enhancing user experience and developer velocity.
- **Extensibility**: Provides a strong, modular foundation for integrating future features, including AI/ML components.

**Cons:**
- Dependency on Google for core authentication, which could be a vendor lock-in concern (though standard and reliable).
- Initial setup overhead for integrating Shadcn UI and configuring Google OAuth.
- Potential learning curve for developers new to Shadcn UI's composition model.

## Decision
We will implement the core application UI using a React frontend, styled with Shadcn UI, and integrate Google OAuth for user authentication. A lightweight backend service will manage Google OAuth callbacks, token validation, user profile storage, and provide basic dashboard data. The frontend will be hosted statically, and backend services will be deployed using serverless technologies.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Establishes a secure, intuitive, and modern entry point for users, directly addressing the
