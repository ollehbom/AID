# ADR-003: Foundational UI & Experience (error-fix-1770404394248)

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The product requires a foundational user interface and experience to enable user interaction and subsequent feature development. This includes establishing a modern React application, integrating Google login, providing a basic dashboard, and defining an initial design system. The goal is to deliver an intuitive, consistent, and performant user experience from the outset, aligning with the product belief that "the product must feel obvious without documentation."

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: This is a foundational build anticipating growth from 1K to 100K+ users. The architecture must support future scalability in terms of performance, maintainability, and feature expansion.
-   **Team expertise**: The chosen technologies should leverage modern frontend development practices, assuming expertise in React and TypeScript, and facilitate rapid development.
-   **Budget**: Standard cloud hosting costs for static assets are assumed. The architecture should be cost-effective without sacrificing core quality or future scalability.
-   **Primary concerns**: Security (robust authentication, data protection), Reliability (graceful error handling, consistent UI), Performance (fast loading, responsive interactions), and Developer Velocity (accelerating future feature development).

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Build a custom UI library from scratch
**Pros:**
-   Complete control over every design and functional detail.
-   Perfectly tailored to unique branding and interaction requirements.

**Cons:**
-   Significantly higher development cost and time for initial setup and ongoing maintenance.
-   Requires substantial design and frontend engineering resources.
-   Slower time to market for the foundational product.
-   Higher risk of inconsistencies without mature design system governance.

### Option 2: Use a comprehensive UI framework (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design)
**Pros:**
-   Provides a rich set of pre-built, well-tested components.
-   Accelerates development due to readily available components and patterns.
-   Often includes accessibility features out-of-the-box.

**Cons:**
-   Can be opinionated, potentially making deep customization to match specific branding challenging or requiring significant overrides.
-   Typically results in larger bundle sizes due to including many components that may not be used.
-   Can lead to a generic or
