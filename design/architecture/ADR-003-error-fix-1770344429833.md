# ADR-003: Foundational UI: React, Shadcn, Google Login, Dashboard

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The product currently lacks a consistent, modern, and functional user interface. This absence prevents further product development and validation, hindering the ability to iterate rapidly and provide an intuitive user experience. The goal is to establish a robust frontend foundation that supports future growth while aligning with core beliefs of speed, intuitiveness, and catering to technically competent users.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: The initial implementation targets an MVP (less than 1K users) but must be architected to support significant growth (1K-100K+ users) and rapid feature iteration.
-   **Team expertise**: Assumes proficiency or quick ramp-up with modern JavaScript, React, and component-based UI development.
-   **Budget**: Prioritize cost-effective hosting and development, leveraging managed services and efficient development practices.
-   **Primary concerns**: Speed of development, intuitive user experience, strong security for user authentication, and maintainability for future features.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React with Shadcn UI (Chosen)
**Description**: Implement the frontend as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React, styled with Shadcn UI components. Google Login will be integrated for user authentication, and a basic dashboard will serve as the initial authenticated view. A core design system will be established using Shadcn's principles.

**Pros:**
-   **Rapid Development**: Shadcn UI provides pre-built, accessible, and customizable components, significantly accelerating UI development.
-   **Modern & Intuitive**: React's component-based architecture combined with Shadcn's aesthetic aligns with a modern, clean, and intuitive user experience, fulfilling the "obvious without documentation" belief.
-   **Strong Ecosystem**: React has a vast ecosystem, tooling, and community support.
-   **Scalability**: The component-based approach and SPA architecture are highly scalable for frontend development and performance.
-   **Secure Authentication**: Google Login leverages a widely trusted and robust OAuth 2.0 provider, enhancing security and user confidence.

**Cons:**
-   **Initial Setup Overhead**: Integrating Shadcn and establishing the design system requires an initial setup phase.
-   **Dependency on Google**: Relying on Google for authentication introduces a dependency, though mitigated by using standard OAuth.
-   **Styling Consistency**: Requires discipline to maintain consistency if custom components deviate from Shadcn's patterns.

### Option 2: Other JavaScript Frameworks (e.g., Vue, Angular) or UI Libraries (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design)
**Description**: Utilize alternative frontend frameworks or UI libraries.

**Pros:**
-   Mature ecosystems and established patterns.
-   Potential for different development paradigms.

**Cons:**
-   May not align as closely with the stated preference for Shadcn's aesthetic and developer experience, potentially slowing down initial development if the team is not already proficient.
-   Could lead to a less cohesive design system if the chosen library is overly opinionated or less flexible for customization.

### Option 3: Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript
**Description**: Build the UI from scratch without a modern frontend framework or component library.

**Pros:**
-   Maximum control over every aspect of the UI.

**Cons:**
-   **Extremely Slow Development**: Significantly higher development time and effort, directly contradicting the need for rapid iteration.
-   **Poor Maintainability & Scalability**: Difficult to maintain and scale a large application without a structured framework and component approach.
-   **Lack of Consistency**: High risk of inconsistent UI/UX without a robust design system framework.

## Decision
We will implement the foundational user interface using **React with Shadcn UI**, integrating **Google Login** for authentication, and building a **basic dashboard**. A core design system will be established based on Shadcn's principles. This approach best balances rapid development, a modern and intuitive user experience, and robust authentication, while providing a scalable foundation for future features.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   **Accelerated UI Development**: Future features will benefit from reusable components and a consistent design system, leading to faster implementation.
-   **Consistent User Experience**: A unified visual language and interaction patterns across the application, enhancing intuitiveness and reducing cognitive load.
-   **Strong Security Foundation**: Leveraging Google's robust authentication mechanisms provides a secure and familiar login experience for users.
-   **Modern Aesthetic**: The chosen stack ensures a contemporary and professional look and feel, aligning with user expectations for speed and intuitiveness.
-   **Improved Developer Experience**: Clear component structure and design system guidelines will streamline collaboration and onboarding for new developers.

**Negative:**
-   **Initial Learning Curve**: Team members unfamiliar with React or Shadcn may require time to ramp up.
-   **Google Dependency**: While beneficial, relying solely on Google Login can limit future flexibility for alternative authentication methods without additional architectural work.

**Risks:**
-   **Authentication Vulnerabilities**: Improper implementation of backend token verification for Google OAuth could expose security flaws. Mitigation: Adhere strictly to OAuth 2.0 best practices and use battle-tested libraries for token validation.
-   **UI/UX Inconsistency**: If the established design system and Shadcn guidelines are not strictly followed, UI fragmentation could occur. Mitigation: Implement Storybook for component documentation, conduct regular design reviews, and enforce linting/code style rules.
-   **Performance Degradation**: Poorly optimized React components or large bundle sizes could lead to slow initial page loads. Mitigation: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and regular performance audits (e.g., Lighthouse).

## Implementation Guidance
-   **Project Setup**: Utilize a modern React build tool like Vite or Create React App for project initialization.
-   **Shadcn Integration**: Follow Shadcn UI documentation for component setup, styling, and theming. Prioritize accessible (A11Y) components.
-   **Google OAuth**: Implement Google Sign-In on the frontend. Ensure the backend performs server-side validation of Google ID tokens to verify user identity and establish an internal session (e.g., using JWTs).
-   **Routing**: Use React Router DOM for client-side routing between login and dashboard views, ensuring protected routes are only accessible after authentication.
-   **API Communication**: All frontend-to-backend communication must use HTTPS. Implement a robust API client (e.g., Axios, Fetch API) with error handling and request/response interceptors.
-   **State Management**: For a basic dashboard, React's `useState` and `useContext` may suffice. Consider libraries like Zustand or Redux Toolkit for more complex global state needs in the future.
-   **Testing**: Implement unit tests (Jest/React Testing Library) for critical components and utility functions. Develop integration tests (Cypress/Playwright) for key user flows (e.g., login, dashboard navigation).
-   **Linting & Formatting**: Configure ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistency across the codebase.
-   **Accessibility**: Integrate accessibility checks into the development workflow and ensure all components meet WCAG standards.
