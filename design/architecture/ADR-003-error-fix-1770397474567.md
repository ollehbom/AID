# ADR-003: Frontend Foundation with React, Shadcn/ui, and Google Login

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The objective is to establish a modern, consistent, and intuitive React frontend application. This foundation includes integrating `shadcn/ui` for styling, implementing Google login for secure user authentication, and creating a basic dashboard as the initial landing page post-authentication. This work is critical for enabling all future product development and user interaction, directly supporting the belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation."

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: This is a foundational build for an application expected to grow from <1K to 1K-100K users. The architecture must support future scaling considerations for the frontend (e.g., bundle size, performance). While current scale is small, the choice impacts future architectural decisions.
-   **Team expertise**: Assumed familiarity with the React ecosystem and a willingness to adopt modern CSS-in-JS/utility-first CSS approaches (Tailwind CSS).
-   **Budget**: Efficient hosting for static assets is preferred to optimize costs, especially in early stages.
-   **Primary concerns**: 
    -   **Security**: Robust and secure implementation of user authentication via Google OAuth.
    -   **Rapid Development**: The chosen tech stack should facilitate quick iteration and feature delivery.
    -   **User Experience (UX)**: A consistent, modern, and intuitive user interface that feels obvious without documentation.
    -   **Maintainability**: A well-structured and easily maintainable codebase.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Build from scratch (React, custom CSS/components)

**Pros:**
-   Complete control over every aspect of the UI and styling.
-   No external UI library dependencies, potentially smaller initial bundle.

**Cons:**
-   Significantly slower initial development due to building all components from first principles.
-   Higher ongoing maintenance burden for a custom design system.
-   Risk of UI/UX inconsistencies without strict design guidelines and enforcement.

### Option 2: Use a full-fledged UI framework (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design)

**Pros:**
-   Provides a comprehensive suite of ready-to-use components, accelerating development.
-   Established design systems ensure consistency out-of-the-box.

**Cons:**
-   Often opinionated in terms of design and styling, potentially limiting custom branding.
-   Can lead to larger bundle sizes due to including many unused components.
-   May introduce a learning curve for the framework's specific APIs and customization methods.

### Option 3: Use `shadcn/ui` with Tailwind CSS (Chosen Approach)

**Pros:**
-   Provides high-quality, accessible, and customizable component primitives that are directly integrated into the project, offering full control.
-   Leverages Tailwind CSS for highly efficient and flexible utility-first styling, enabling rapid design iteration.
-   Only includes the necessary component code, leading to optimized bundle sizes.
-   Modern aesthetic and excellent developer experience, fostering consistency and speed.
-   Strong community support and alignment with modern frontend development practices.

**Cons:**
-   Requires familiarity with Tailwind CSS, which may have an initial learning curve if the team is not accustomed to it.
-   Requires more
