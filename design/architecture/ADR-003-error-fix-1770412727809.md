# ADR-003: Core UI Foundation and Google Login

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This Architecture Decision Record (ADR) addresses the establishment of the foundational React application structure, including a modern design system using `shadcn/ui`, functional Google login, and a basic dashboard with mock content. The primary goal is to create a consistent, intuitive, and efficient base for future feature development, aligning with the product belief that "The product must feel obvious without documentation." This initiative resolves the current absence of a unified design language and a stable application structure.

## Decision Drivers
- **Scale:** The initial target is <1K users, but the architecture must inherently support growth to 1K-100K users without significant refactoring. Scalability for both frontend assets and backend authentication services is crucial.
- **Team expertise:** We assume the development team has strong proficiency in modern React development, JavaScript/TypeScript, and cloud-native services. Leveraging familiar technologies will enhance development velocity and operational ease.
- **Budget:** The initial setup should be cost-efficient, utilizing managed cloud services (e.g., serverless functions, static hosting via CDN) to minimize operational overhead and scale costs proportionally with usage.
- **Primary concerns:** Security (robust authentication, data protection), Reliability (error handling, session management), Performance (fast UI, responsive login), Operational Excellence (testability, deployability, monitoring), and Cost Optimization (efficient resource utilization).

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React + shadcn/ui + Google OAuth + Custom Backend Auth (Chosen)
**Pros:**
- **Modern UI/UX:** `shadcn/ui` provides a highly customizable, accessible, and modern component library, enabling a consistent and intuitive user experience aligned with the product's core belief.
- **Flexibility & Control:** Full control over the frontend application logic and the backend authentication flow, allowing for custom user management, authorization rules, and future integration with other identity providers.
- **Scalability:** React applications can be highly performant and scalable (static assets via CDN), while a dedicated backend service allows for independent scaling of authentication logic.
- **Security:** Standard Google OAuth 2.0 flow combined with a custom backend ensures secure token handling, user session management, and API protection.
- **Developer Experience:** Leveraging well-established technologies (React) and a modern component library (`shadcn/ui`) generally leads to higher developer velocity and easier maintenance.

**Cons:**
- **Development Effort:** Requires dedicated development effort for both frontend (React app, `shadcn/ui` integration) and backend (OAuth callback, token validation, user management).
- **Complexity:** Managing authentication tokens (access, refresh) securely between frontend and backend, along with session management, adds moderate architectural complexity.

### Option 2: React + another UI library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design) + Google OAuth + Custom Backend Auth
**Pros:**
- Similar benefits to Option 1 regarding core architecture.
- Different aesthetic and component set may appeal to different design preferences.

**Cons:**
- `shadcn/ui` was specifically chosen for its
