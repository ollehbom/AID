## Status
Proposed

## Context
This Architecture Decision Record addresses the foundational build of the product's user interface. The objective is to establish a core React application, integrate Shadcn UI for styling, implement Google OAuth for user authentication, and create a basic dashboard. This initiative is critical as it provides the initial tangible application for user interaction and serves as the extensible base for all subsequent feature development.
