# ADR-003: Foundational React Application with Google OAuth and Shadcn/ui

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The current product lacks a tangible, deployable application, hindering real user interaction and validation of core product hypotheses. This ADR addresses the need to establish a foundational React application, incorporating a modern design system (shadcn/ui), essential user authentication via Google OAuth, and a basic dashboard. This platform will enable subsequent product experimentation and faster validation of core value propositions.

## Decision Drivers
- **Scale**: The initial target is <1K users for early validation, but the architecture must support future growth to 1K-100K+ users without requiring a complete rewrite.
- **Team expertise**: Assumed proficiency in React and modern frontend development practices. The chosen technologies should leverage or build upon existing team skills efficiently.
- **Budget**: The solution must be cost-effective for an MVP stage, minimizing infrastructure and operational costs.
- **Primary concerns**: Rapid development and deployment, robust and secure user authentication, maintainability of the codebase, and a performant user experience from the outset.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Client-Side React Application with Shadcn/ui, Google OAuth, and Static Hosting (Chosen)
**Pros:**
- **Rapid Development**: React, coupled with shadcn/ui's composable components, allows for quick UI assembly.
- **Cost-Effective**: Static hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3+CloudFront) is highly economical, with minimal operational overhead.
- **High Performance & Scalability**: CDNs provide excellent global performance and automatically scale to handle high traffic for static assets.
- **Standard Authentication**: Google OAuth is a widely adopted, secure, and user-friendly authentication mechanism, reducing custom security implementation.
- **Maintainability**: A modular React application with a defined design system promotes clean code and easier future development.

**Cons:**
- **Initial Setup Overhead**: Integrating shadcn/ui and setting up the Google OAuth flow requires careful initial configuration.
- **Backend Dependency for Session Management**: While Google handles initial auth, a backend service will eventually be needed for secure session management and API access control, adding future complexity.
- **SEO Limitations**: Pure client-side rendering can impact SEO if not addressed with pre-rendering or SSR (not a primary concern for this MVP).

### Option 2: React with a Different UI Library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design)
**Pros:**
- **Mature Ecosystems**: These libraries offer extensive component sets and strong community support.
- **Established Patterns**: Well-defined design language and interaction patterns.

**Cons:**
- **Potential for Heavier Bundle Size**: Some libraries can be more opinionated and include larger bundles than shadcn/ui's à la carte approach.
- **Less Alignment with Desired Aesthetic**: Shadcn/ui offers a more
