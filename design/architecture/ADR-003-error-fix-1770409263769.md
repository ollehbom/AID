# ADR-003: Foundational React UI with Google Login and shadcn/UI

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The organization currently lacks a modern, standardized frontend application base, leading to difficulties in rapidly prototyping and building new user-facing features. This decision addresses the need to establish a robust, extensible, and consistent UI foundation that aligns with core product beliefs: "Users value speed over configurability", "The primary user is technically competent", and "The product must feel obvious without documentation". This foundation will enable faster iteration on user-facing features and prepare for future product evolution, including potential AI integrations.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: The chosen architecture must serve as a scalable foundation, supporting initial low user counts but capable of scaling to 1K-100K+ users as the product grows.
-   **Team expertise**: The team is assumed to be proficient in modern web development, particularly React. The chosen technologies should leverage this expertise or have clear learning paths.
-   **Budget**: Frontend hosting should be cost-effective at various scales, favoring managed services or serverless deployments.
-   **Primary concerns**: Rapid development velocity, consistent and intuitive user experience, robust and secure authentication, and high performance (fast loading and responsiveness).

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Custom UI Development from Scratch
**Pros:**
-   Complete control over every aspect of the UI and styling.
-   No external UI library dependencies, potentially smaller initial bundle size.

**Cons:**
-   Significantly slower development time due to building all components and design system primitives from scratch.
-   Higher risk of design inconsistencies without a strong, pre-defined framework.
-   Increased maintenance overhead for custom components.

### Option 2: Alternative UI Framework (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design)
**Pros:**
-   Mature, extensive component libraries with strong community support.
-   Provides a consistent design system out-of-the-box.

**Cons:**
-   Often more opinionated, which might restrict customization options or enforce a specific aesthetic that doesn't align perfectly with our
