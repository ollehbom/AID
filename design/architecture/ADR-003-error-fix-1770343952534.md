# ADR-003: Establish Core React Application Foundation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The product requires a foundational frontend application to enable subsequent feature development. The current state is a lack of any functional platform. This decision addresses the need for a modern, consistent, and efficient development environment, integrating a design system and secure authentication.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: Initial user base is expected to be small (<1K users), but the architecture must support growth to 1K-100K users without significant refactoring. This initial setup is foundational for future scalability.
-   **Team expertise**: Assumed team expertise in React, TypeScript, and modern frontend development practices. Leveraging existing knowledge is key for rapid delivery.
-   **Budget**: Cost-sensitive, aiming for efficient hosting and development practices to minimize operational expenses.
-   **Primary concerns**: Rapid prototyping and development velocity, ensuring UI consistency across the application, establishing secure and reliable authentication, and delivering a performant user experience from the outset.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React with shadcn/ui and Google Login (Chosen)
**Pros:**
-   **Rapid Development**: `shadcn/ui` provides pre-built, accessible components, significantly accelerating UI development.
-   **UI Consistency**: Enforces a consistent design system, aligning with the product belief that
