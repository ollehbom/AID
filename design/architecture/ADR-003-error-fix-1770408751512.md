# ADR-003: Foundational React Application with Integrated Error Handling

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This Architecture Decision Record addresses the foundational build-out of a modern React application. This includes integrating Shadcn UI for a consistent aesthetic, implementing Google login for user authentication, creating a basic dashboard as the initial user interface, and establishing the core components of a design system. Crucially, it also encompasses the design and implementation of a robust, user-centric error handling system across the application. This foundational work addresses the critical need for a stable, scalable, and aesthetically consistent platform upon which all future user-facing features can be built, directly supporting the product belief that the application should feel "obvious without documentation" and accelerate future development.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: The foundation must support future growth, anticipating 1K-100K+ users and requests. The architecture should be inherently scalable for frontend delivery and extensible for backend integration.
-   **Team expertise**: Assumed proficiency in modern React development, JavaScript/TypeScript, and cloud-native frontend deployment patterns. The chosen technologies leverage common industry standards.
-   **Budget**: Given startup context, cost-efficiency for hosting and operational overhead is critical. Preference for serverless/managed services.
-   **Primary concerns**: 
    -   **Security**: Robust and secure implementation of user authentication (Google Login) to protect user data and maintain trust.
    -   **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling to ensure a stable user experience, prevent application crashes, and provide clear guidance during unexpected issues.
    -   **Performance**: A responsive and fast user interface, especially during initial load and data fetching.
    -   **Developer Velocity**: Establish a strong foundation and design system to accelerate future feature development and maintain consistency.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Build with React, Shadcn, Google Login, and a comprehensive custom error handling system (Chosen Approach)
**Pros:**
-   Provides maximum flexibility and control over the frontend architecture, security, and user experience.
-   React and Shadcn UI offer a modern, performant, and extensible platform for rapid development and consistent design.
-   Allows for tailored, user-centric error messages and recovery flows, directly supporting the
