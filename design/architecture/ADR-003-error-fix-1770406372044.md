# ADR-003: Foundational UI with React and Shadcn

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This Architecture Decision Record addresses the foundational user interface (UI) development for the product, as outlined in the Product Decision Record and Design Specifications for feature `error-fix-1770406372044`. The current state lacks any visual, interactive entry point, hindering user engagement and feature development. The goal is to establish a modern, component-based UI using React and Shadcn, implement Google login, and provide a basic dashboard to validate our approach to user interface and development speed, aligning with core product beliefs of intuitiveness and speed.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: Anticipate a growing user base (initially 1K-100K users), requiring a scalable and performant frontend architecture that can support increasing traffic without significant re-architecture.
-   **Team expertise**: Assumed proficiency with modern JavaScript frameworks (React) and a desire for rapid development and iteration, leveraging existing skills.
-   **Budget**: Cost-sensitive development and hosting, favoring solutions that offer efficiency in both development time and operational expenditure.
-   **Primary concerns**: User experience (intuitiveness, speed, aesthetics), security (robust authentication), and development velocity (fast iteration, maintainability).

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React + Shadcn UI (Chosen)
**Pros:**
-   **Rapid Development**: Shadcn's component-based approach, often involving copy-pasting and customizing components, significantly accelerates UI development and prototyping.
-   **Modern Aesthetics**: Provides a clean, professional, and contemporary design system out-of-the-box, aligning with the
