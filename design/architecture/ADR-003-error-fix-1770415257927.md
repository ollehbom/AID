# ADR-003: Core Frontend Setup (Google Login & Dashboard)

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This Architecture Decision Record (ADR) addresses the foundational setup of the application's frontend. The goal is to establish a functional React application integrated with the Shadcn UI component library, implement Google OAuth for user authentication, and create a basic dashboard as the initial user interface. This foundational work is critical for unblocking all subsequent feature development, enabling user interaction, and validating core product beliefs.

## Decision Drivers
- **Rapid Development**: Need to quickly establish a working frontend to accelerate future feature delivery and user experiments.
- **User Experience**: Provide a familiar, intuitive, and visually consistent experience from the first interaction.
- **Security**: Implement a secure and widely adopted authentication mechanism.
- **Scalability**: Lay a foundation that can efficiently scale from initial internal testing to a growing user base (1K-100K users).
- **Cost Efficiency**: Utilize technologies and deployment strategies that are cost-effective for an MVP phase.
- **Team Expertise**: Leverage common web development patterns and frameworks to align with assumed team capabilities.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Custom UI/Component Library & Traditional Auth
**Approach**: Build UI components from scratch or use a less opinionated styling framework (e.g., bare CSS modules, Styled Components) and implement a custom email/password authentication system.

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility in UI design and customization.
- Full control over the authentication process and user data.

**Cons:**
- Significantly slower development velocity due to building components from first principles.
- Higher development cost and effort for design system consistency.
- Increased security burden for managing user credentials (hashing, storage, password resets, etc.).
- Less familiar user experience for authentication.

### Option 2: React, Shadcn UI, Google OAuth (Chosen Approach)
**Approach**: Utilize React for the frontend framework, Shadcn UI for pre-built, customizable components, and Google OAuth for user authentication, deployed as static assets.

**Pros:**
- **High Development Velocity**: Shadcn UI provides accessible, pre-styled components, drastically speeding up UI development.
- **Consistent UI/UX**: Enforces a consistent design language from the outset, supporting the
