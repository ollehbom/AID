# ADR-003: Frontend Application Foundation with React, shadcn/ui, and Google Login

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This Architecture Decision Record addresses the foundational frontend architecture for the product. The goal is to establish a robust, modern, and intuitive user interface by implementing a React application, integrating `shadcn/ui` for a consistent design system, and enabling secure user authentication via Google Login. This foundation will serve as the canvas for all future feature development, user experience testing, and ensure alignment with our product beliefs regarding an "obvious" and "intuitive" user experience.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Product Goal**: Create an intuitive, modern, and obvious user experience without requiring extensive documentation. (Aligns with product belief: "The product must feel obvious without documentation" and "Onboarding flow is intuitive without guidance.")
-   **Rapid Iteration**: Enable efficient and fast development of future features through a component-based UI framework and a consistent design system.
-   **Scalability**: The chosen frontend stack should be capable of supporting growth from initial users to a larger user base without significant re-architecture.
-   **Security**: Implement a secure and user-friendly authentication mechanism (Google Login).
-   **Team Expertise**: Leverage common and well-supported web technologies to ensure maintainability and attract talent.
-   **Consistency**: Establish a unified visual language and interaction patterns across the application from the outset.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React with shadcn/ui and Google OAuth (Chosen Approach)
**Pros:**
-   **Modern & Performant**: React is a highly popular, performant, and well-supported JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **Component-Based**: Encourages modular, reusable components, accelerating development and improving maintainability.
-   **Unstyled Components (shadcn/ui)**: `shadcn/ui` provides high-quality, accessible, and unstyled components that integrate seamlessly with Tailwind CSS, allowing for full control over styling and branding without fighting opinionated component styles. This is crucial for establishing a unique design system.
-   **Strong Ecosystem**: Vast community support, extensive libraries, and tooling available for React and Tailwind CSS.
-   **Secure Authentication**: Google OAuth provides a widely trusted, secure, and convenient login experience for users, reducing the burden of managing user credentials directly.
-   **Excellent Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, strong debugging tools, and type safety (with TypeScript) contribute to high developer velocity.

**Cons:**
-   **Bundle Size**: While optimized, React applications can have larger initial bundle sizes compared to simpler alternatives, requiring careful optimization.
-   **Learning Curve**: For developers new to React, Tailwind CSS, or `shadcn/ui`, there is an initial learning curve.
-   **State Management Complexity**: As the application grows, managing global state can become complex without a well-defined strategy.

### Option 2: Vue.js or Angular with a different UI library
**Pros:**
-   Vue.js offers a progressive framework with a gentler learning curve for some.
-   Angular provides a comprehensive, opinionated framework suitable for large enterprise applications.
**Cons:**
-   May not align as well with the team's existing or desired expertise (if React is preferred).
-   Other UI libraries might be more opinionated in their styling, making custom design system integration harder than `shadcn/ui`.

### Option 3: Vanilla JavaScript or a micro-frontend approach
**Pros:**
-   Vanilla JS offers maximum control and potentially smallest bundle size.
-   Micro-frontends could offer extreme modularity for very large, distributed teams.
**Cons:**
-   Significantly higher development effort and slower iteration for initial foundation.
-   Lack of established patterns and tooling for UI components, leading to inconsistency.
-   Overkill for an initial product foundation.

## Decision
We will proceed with **React as the core frontend framework, integrated with `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS for UI components and styling, and Google OAuth for user authentication.** The application will be a single-page application (SPA) deployed as static assets.

## Rationale
This approach best balances rapid development, a modern user experience, strong security practices for authentication, and future scalability. React's component-based nature, combined with `shadcn/ui`'s flexible and unstyled components, provides an ideal platform for building a unique, consistent, and performant design system. Google OAuth streamlines user onboarding and leverages a trusted identity provider, reducing our security surface area. This stack aligns with industry best practices for modern web applications and facilitates a smooth developer workflow.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   **Accelerated Development**: Component reusability and a well-defined design system will significantly speed up feature implementation.
-   **Consistent UI/UX**: `shadcn/ui` ensures a uniform look and feel, enhancing user experience and reinforcing product beliefs.
-   **Strong Security Foundation**: Google OAuth provides robust, industry-standard authentication.
-   **High Performance**: Optimized React builds and static hosting via CDN will ensure fast load times and responsiveness.
-   **Maintainability**: Clear component boundaries and modern tooling will make the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

**Negative:**
-   **Initial Setup Overhead**: Integrating React, `shadcn/ui`, Tailwind CSS, and Google OAuth requires careful initial configuration.
-   **Bundle Size Management**: Ongoing attention will be needed to optimize bundle sizes to prevent performance degradation as the application grows.

**Risks:**
-   **Inconsistent Styling**: Without strict adherence to Tailwind CSS utility classes and `shadcn/ui` component usage, design consistency could degrade over time.
-   **Security Vulnerabilities**: Improper implementation of Google OAuth (e.g., exposing client secrets, not validating tokens on the backend) could lead to security breaches.
-   **Performance Bottlenecks**: Poorly optimized React components or excessive re-renders could impact perceived performance.
-   **Accessibility Oversight**: While `shadcn/ui` components are accessible, custom implementations must also adhere to accessibility standards.

## Implementation Guidance
-   **Project Setup**: Initialize a React project using Vite or Next.js (if server-side rendering is desired later), configure Tailwind CSS, and integrate `shadcn/ui` following their official guides.
-   **Authentication**: Implement Google OAuth using a library like `react-google-oauth` or a custom flow that securely exchanges the Google ID token with a backend authentication service to issue application-specific session tokens (JWTs). Ensure the backend validates Google tokens and issues secure, short-lived session tokens.
-   **State Management**: Start with React Context for global state (e.g., user authentication status). Consider libraries like Zustand or Jotai for more complex state needs as the application evolves.
-   **Routing**: Use `react-router-dom` for client-side routing, implementing protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users to the login screen.
-   **Component Structure**: Organize components logically (e.g., `components/ui` for `shadcn/ui` overrides, `components/features` for feature-specific components, `layouts` for page layouts).
-   **Styling**: Exclusively use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling. Create custom `shadcn/ui` components by extending existing ones where necessary, maintaining consistency.
-   **Accessibility**: Prioritize accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) in all custom components and ensure proper semantic HTML. Leverage `shadcn/ui`'s built-in accessibility features.
-   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error boundaries in React for graceful degradation and centralized error reporting (e.g., Sentry). Display user-friendly error messages.
-   **Testing**: Establish a comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests (Jest/React Testing Library), integration tests for critical flows (e.g., login, protected routes), and end-to-end tests (Cypress/Playwright).
-   **Deployment**: Configure CI/CD to build the React application and deploy static assets to a CDN (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3 + CloudFront) for optimal global performance and scalability.
