# ADR-003: Foundational React Application with Google Login and Shadcn/ui

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This Architecture Decision Record addresses the need to establish the foundational React application for the product. Currently, there is no existing application framework, which blocks the development and testing of user-facing features. The objective is to build a robust, intuitive, and modern application shell, integrating a consistent UI framework (shadcn/ui), secure Google login, and a basic dashboard to accelerate future product development and align with the core belief that the product must feel obvious.

## Decision Drivers
- **Scale**: Initially targeting <1K users, but the architecture must be inherently scalable to support future growth towards 1K-100K users without significant re-architecture.
- **Team expertise**: The engineering team is proficient in React development, making a React-based solution efficient for implementation and maintenance.
- **Budget**: Implied focus on cost-efficiency, leveraging managed cloud services and serverless patterns where appropriate to minimize operational overhead.
- **Primary concerns**: Rapid development velocity, intuitive user experience, robust security (especially for authentication), and frontend performance efficiency.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React + shadcn/ui + Google OAuth (Chosen)
**Description**: Utilize React for the frontend framework, integrate shadcn/ui for a modern and consistent component library, and implement Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.

**Pros:**
- **Rapid Development**: React's component-based architecture and shadcn/ui's pre-built, customizable components will significantly accelerate UI development.
- **Consistent UI/UX**: shadcn/ui provides a strong foundation for a consistent and polished user experience, aligning with the
