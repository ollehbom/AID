# ADR-003: Core UI Foundation with Google Login

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The project currently lacks a foundational User Interface (UI) to efficiently build and test user-facing features. This necessitates establishing a modern, robust, and consistent frontend. This Architecture Decision Record (ADR) addresses the requirement to build a core React application, integrate a modern design system (`shadcn/ui`), implement secure Google OAuth for user authentication, and provide a basic dashboard for authenticated users. This foundation is crucial for accelerating future feature development, ensuring a cohesive user experience, and validating core product hypotheses.

## Decision Drivers
- **Scale**: The chosen architecture must support a growing user base (initially 1K-100K users) and be extensible for rapid iteration and future feature expansion.
- **Team expertise**: Leverage common web development expertise (React, TypeScript) while adopting modern, efficient UI frameworks.
- **Budget**: Opt for cost-effective hosting and managed services where possible to optimize operational expenses.
- **Primary concerns**: Security (robust, trusted authentication), developer velocity (accelerated feature implementation), consistent user experience, and performance (fast loading and responsive UI).

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Build a custom UI framework from scratch with traditional username/password authentication.

**Pros:**
- Absolute control over every aspect of the UI and authentication logic.

**Cons:**
- Extremely time-consuming and high development cost, significantly slowing down initial product launch.
- Difficult to maintain UI consistency and quality without dedicated design resources.
- Introduces significant security overhead for managing user credentials, password resets, and brute-force protection.
- Not suitable for a lean startup aiming for rapid iteration.

### Option 2: Use a full-featured UI framework (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design) with traditional username/password authentication.

**Pros:**
- Faster development than custom, with a rich set of pre-built components.
- Established community and documentation for common UI patterns.

**Cons:**
- Frameworks can be opinionated, potentially limiting design flexibility or leading to larger bundle sizes.
- Traditional authentication still adds significant complexity and security burden compared to OAuth.
- May introduce vendor lock-in for design system components.

### Option 3: Adopt `shadcn/ui` with Google OAuth for authentication.

**Pros:**
- `shadcn/ui` provides unstyled, composable components built on Tailwind CSS, offering high flexibility, modern aesthetics, and minimal styling overhead. It encourages a
