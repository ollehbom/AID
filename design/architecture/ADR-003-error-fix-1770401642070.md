# ADR-003: Foundational React Application with Google Login and shadcn/ui

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The product currently lacks a unified frontend application and a standardized design system. This leads to inconsistent UI/UX and hinders rapid feature development. This ADR addresses the need to establish a modern, scalable, and maintainable frontend foundation, including core authentication and a basic dashboard, guided by the principle that "The product must feel obvious without documentation."

## Decision Drivers
- **Scale**: The foundational architecture must support future growth from <1K to 100K+ users, ensuring performance and scalability.
- **Team expertise**: The team is competent in modern web technologies, making React a suitable choice. `shadcn/ui` leverages existing React knowledge.
- **Budget**: Maintain a cost-effective solution, utilizing open-source frameworks and cloud-managed services where appropriate (e.g., for authentication).
- **Primary concerns**:
    - **Security**: Robust and secure user authentication (Google Login).
    - **Developer Velocity**: Rapid future feature development.
    - **User Experience**: Consistent, intuitive, and high-quality UI/UX.
    - **Maintainability**: Easy to update and extend the frontend.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Vanilla React with custom CSS/component library
**Pros:**
- Full control over styling, potentially smaller bundle size if optimized well.
**Cons:**
- High development overhead for design system, slower initial development, potential for inconsistency, requires significant UI/UX expertise in-house.

### Option 2: React with a full-fledged component library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design)
**Pros:**
- Rich set of pre-built components, faster development than custom.
**Cons:**
- Can be opinionated, harder to customize deeply without significant effort, potentially larger bundle size, less "headless" than `shadcn/ui`.

### Option 3: React with `shadcn/ui` (Chosen)
**Pros:**
- "Headless" components offer maximum flexibility and customization while providing robust primitives. Components are directly integrated into the project, allowing easy modification. Leverages Tailwind CSS for rapid styling. Excellent developer experience. Aligns well with the need for a modern, clean aesthetic and rapid development. Strong community support.
**Cons:**
- Requires familiarity with Tailwind CSS. Initial setup involves copying components, which can feel less "plug-and-play" than traditional libraries, but provides greater control.

## Decision
We will implement the foundational React application using `shadcn/ui` for UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Google OAuth for user authentication. The application will be a Single Page Application (SPA) hosted statically (e.g., S3 + CloudFront). Authentication will be handled via an OAuth flow, with the backend responsible for token validation and session management.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Accelerated future feature development due to a robust component library and design system.
- Consistent and modern user experience.
- Strong security foundation for user authentication through Google OAuth.
- High degree of customization and control over UI components.
- Lean frontend bundle size due to `shadcn/ui`'s "bring your own components" approach.
**Negative:**
- Initial learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Tailwind CSS or `shadcn/ui`'s component integration model.
- Reliance on Google for authentication, which could be a single point of failure (mitigated by Google's reliability).
**Risks:**
- Over-customization of `shadcn/ui` components leading to a "fork" that is hard to maintain or update.
- Potential for security misconfigurations in the OAuth flow, requiring careful implementation and review.
- Performance bottlenecks if the initial dashboard grows without proper optimization.

## Implementation Guidance
- Utilize `create-react-app` or Next.js for project initialization, integrating `shadcn/ui` as per its official documentation.
- Implement Google OAuth using a library like `@react-oauth/google` on the frontend, coordinating with a backend service for token validation and session creation (e.g., JWTs stored in secure, HttpOnly cookies).
- Ensure all API calls from the frontend are secured with HTTPS.
- Implement robust error handling for the login process, providing clear user feedback.
- Design the basic dashboard with modular components to allow for easy expansion.
- Document `shadcn/ui` component usage and styling guidelines as part of the initial design system.
- Implement unit and integration tests for the authentication flow and key UI components.
