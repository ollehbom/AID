# ADR-003: Foundational React Application with Google Login and Shadcn/ui

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our product currently lacks a user-facing application, preventing any user interaction and validation of core product beliefs. This decision addresses the critical need to establish a foundational user interface that supports Google login and provides a basic dashboard. This initial UI will serve as the entry point for users, enable future experiments, and facilitate the testing of beliefs such as "Users value speed over configurability" and "The product must feel obvious without documentation."

## Decision Drivers
-   **Scale**: The foundational UI must be designed to accommodate anticipated growth, supporting a user base from 1K to 100K+ users as the product matures. Frontend scalability via CDN is paramount.
-   **Team expertise**: We assume existing or rapidly acquirable expertise in React and modern JavaScript development practices. The chosen technologies should leverage or build upon this skillset.
-   **Budget**: As an MVP phase, the solution must be cost-effective, favoring managed services and efficient resource utilization for both development and hosting.
-   **Primary concerns**: Rapid development velocity, intuitive and consistent user experience, robust security for authentication, high performance, and reliability of the core application flow (login, dashboard access).

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Build with React, Shadcn/ui, and Google OAuth (Chosen)
**Pros:**
-   **Modern & Performant**: React provides a highly efficient and widely adopted framework for building dynamic UIs.
-   **Rapid Development**: Shadcn/ui, built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, offers a comprehensive, accessible, and highly customizable component library, significantly accelerating UI development and ensuring consistency.
-   **Trusted Authentication**: Google OAuth is a widely recognized and secure authentication method, reducing friction for users and leveraging an established identity provider.
-   **Scalability**: React applications are easily scalable via static hosting and CDNs for the frontend, with backend authentication services designed for horizontal scaling.
-   **Maintainability**: A component-based approach with a well-defined design system enhances code organization and long-term maintainability.

**Cons:**
-   **Initial Setup Overhead**: Integrating React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui requires careful initial configuration.
-   **Bundle Size**: If not optimized, the application bundle size could impact initial load times, though this is mitigated with modern build tools and practices.

### Option 2: Use a Low-Code/No-Code Platform for Frontend
**Pros:**
-   **Extremely Fast Initial Deployment**: Can get a basic UI up and running very quickly.

**Cons:**
-   **Limited Customization & Flexibility**: May not meet specific design requirements or complex interactive patterns needed for a
