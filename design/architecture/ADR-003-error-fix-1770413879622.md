# ADR-003: Core UI, Google Login, and Basic Dashboard Foundation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This architectural decision addresses the foundational requirement to establish the product's initial application shell, including a modern user interface, secure user authentication via Google Login, and a basic dashboard displaying mock content. The primary problem being solved is the current inability to onboard users, test features, or demonstrate product value due to the absence of a functional and visually consistent application entry point. This foundation is critical for accelerating future feature development and validation, aligning with the product's core beliefs around intuitiveness and speed.

## Decision Drivers
- **Scale**: The product anticipates growth beyond an initial MVP, necessitating a scalable frontend and authentication solution that can handle a growing user base without significant re-architecture.
- **Team expertise**: Assumed familiarity with modern web development practices, specifically React and associated frameworks, which aligns with the chosen technologies.
- **Budget**: The solution must be cost-effective for an MVP while providing a clear path for scaling without incurring disproportionate costs.
- **Primary concerns**: Security (robust authentication to protect user data), Performance (fast loading times and a responsive UI), and Operational Excellence (maintainability, testability, and observability of the system).

## Options Considered

### Option 1: React (Next.js/Vite), Shadcn UI, Google OAuth (backend-verified) - (Chosen)
**Pros:**
- **Modern & Performant**: Leverages contemporary React frameworks (e.g., Next.js for SSR/SSG benefits or Vite for fast development) known for performance.
- **Consistent UI**: Shadcn UI provides a high-quality, accessible, and consistent component library, accelerating UI development and ensuring a professional look and feel.
- **Robust Security**: Implementing Google OAuth with backend token verification ensures a strong security posture, mitigating common client-side authentication vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability**: Frontend can be easily hosted on a CDN; backend authentication can be implemented with serverless functions or scalable microservices.

**Cons:**
- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Requires coordination between frontend and backend development for secure OAuth flow.
- **Learning Curve**: Potential learning curve for Shadcn UI if the team is unfamiliar.

### Option 2: Pure client-side Google OAuth with Firebase/Supabase Auth (minimal backend)
**Pros:**
- **Faster Implementation**: Significantly reduces backend code and setup complexity, allowing for quicker initial deployment.
- **Managed Services**: Relies heavily on managed authentication services, offloading operational burden.

**Cons:**
- **Security Risks**: Greater reliance on client-side security, which can be prone to vulnerabilities if not configured perfectly. Less control over the full authentication process.
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tighter coupling with a specific third-party service for authentication and potentially user data storage.
- **Limited Customization**: Less flexibility for custom authentication logic or integrating with existing backend systems.

### Option 3: Traditional Server-Side Rendered (SSR) application with custom authentication
**Pros:**
- **Full Control**: Complete control over all aspects of the application and authentication logic.
- **Simpler for Small Teams (potentially)**: Can be simpler if the team has strong expertise in a single full-stack framework.

**Cons:**
- **Slower UI Development**: Generally slower for building rich, interactive user interfaces compared to modern React frameworks.
- **Higher Operational Overhead**: Requires managing custom authentication logic, including password hashing, session management, and security best practices, which is complex and error-prone.
- **Less Modern Feel**: May not achieve the desired
