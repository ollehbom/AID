# ADR-003: Foundational React App with Shadcn UI and Google Login

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This architectural decision addresses the need to establish a foundational React application for the product. The goal is to create a modern, intuitive, and rapidly developable product experience, starting with core components like login and a basic dashboard. This foundation is critical for unblocking subsequent feature development and gathering early user feedback, aligning with our product beliefs around speed, intuitiveness, and catering to technically competent users.

## Decision Drivers
-   **Rapid Development**: The need to quickly build and iterate on UI components to accelerate product delivery.
-   **Intuitive User Experience (UX)**: Deliver a fast-feeling, obvious, and professional UI that requires minimal documentation.
-   **Technical User Base**: Design and technology choices should resonate with technically competent founders/developers.
-   **Modern Stack**: Leverage contemporary frontend technologies and design patterns.
-   **Secure & Convenient Authentication**: Implement a robust and user-friendly authentication mechanism.
-   **Consistency & Maintainability**: Establish a consistent visual language and easily maintainable codebase from the outset.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Custom UI Framework/CSS from Scratch
**Pros:**
-   Complete control over design and implementation.
-   Potentially smallest bundle size if meticulously optimized.
**Cons:**
-   Extremely slow development velocity for foundational components.
-   High effort to ensure accessibility, responsiveness, and cross-browser compatibility.
-   Risk of inconsistent UI/UX without strict design system enforcement.

### Option 2: Full-featured UI Library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design)
**Pros:**
-   Faster development than custom solutions due to pre-built components.
-   Provides a comprehensive design system and accessibility features out-of-the-box.
**Cons:**
-   Often opinionated, leading to a generic look and feel that might require significant customization to align with specific brand identity.
-   Can be heavy in terms of bundle size, potentially impacting initial load performance.
-   Customization can sometimes be complex or require overriding styles, leading to maintenance challenges.

### Option 3: Shadcn UI with React and Google OAuth (Chosen Approach)
**Pros:**
-   **Rapid Development**: Shadcn UI provides composable, pre-styled components that can be easily integrated and customized, significantly boosting development speed.
-   **Modern & Flexible Design**: Components are headless (styled via Tailwind CSS), offering immense flexibility for customization while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic.
-   **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind, reducing effort in this critical area.
-   **Performance**: Lightweight components and efficient styling contribute to a fast-feeling application.
-   **Secure Authentication**: Google OAuth offers a widely adopted, secure, and convenient authentication method, reducing the burden of managing user credentials directly.
-   **Team Familiarity**: React is a well-understood framework for technical teams.
**Cons:**
-   Requires familiarity with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn's component composition paradigm.
-   Dependency on Google for primary authentication, though this can be abstracted.

## Decision
We will build the foundational React application using **React (with Vite for development/bundling or Next.js for SSR/SSG if needed later), Shadcn UI for the component library, and Google OAuth for authentication.**

## Rationale
This approach strikes the best balance between rapid development, modern aesthetics, performance, and security. Shadcn UI's philosophy of providing
