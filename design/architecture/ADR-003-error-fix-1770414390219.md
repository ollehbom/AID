# ADR-003: Foundational UI/UX for Product Application

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The immediate need is to establish the core user interface and experience for the product. This involves creating a basic React application, integrating a modern styling framework (`shadcn/ui`), implementing a Google login flow, and a simple dashboard. This foundational work is critical to unblock all subsequent frontend feature development and align with the founder's vision for a visually appealing, intuitive, and rapidly extensible product.

## Decision Drivers
- **Scale**: The architecture must be foundational for future growth, supporting 1K-100K users without requiring a complete overhaul. Initial implementation should be light for <1K users.
- **Team Expertise**: The solution should leverage common web development skills, particularly in React, to ensure the small founding team can rapidly develop and maintain the system.
- **Budget**: The initial hosting budget is constrained (<$100/month), necessitating cost-efficient solutions, particularly for static asset delivery and authentication services.
- **Primary Concerns**: Prioritize speed of development to deliver an MVP quickly, ensure an intuitive and consistent UI/UX, and establish robust security for user authentication.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Build a custom UI framework from scratch
**Pros:**
- Complete control over every aspect of the UI and components.
- No external styling framework dependencies.
**Cons:**
- Extremely high initial development time and ongoing maintenance burden.
- High risk of inconsistent design and accessibility issues without dedicated design resources.
- Does not align with the product's belief in
