The foundational design for the Google login and basic dashboard largely aligns with the product's core beliefs of being obvious without documentation, valuing speed, and catering to technically competent users. For the Google login flow, the standard 'Sign in with Google' interaction is highly predictable for new users, directly addressing the 'can a new user predict what happens next?' rule. Ensuring clear, concise error states for failed logins will prevent friction and align with the 'nothing explained too late' principle. The UI's directness matches the intent of a swift, intuitive entry.

The 'basic dashboard with mock content' is the primary area requiring careful consideration. While the intent is to establish a foundation, the design of this dashboard must clearly communicate its *future* purpose, even with placeholders. To ensure the UI matches the intent and new users can predict next steps, the mock content should hint at the product's core value (e.g., 'Your projects will be listed here,' or 'Start by creating your first workflow'). An overly generic or empty dashboard could fail the 'obvious without documentation' rule, leading to confusion. The consistent application of `shadcn/ui` will contribute to a modern feel and consistency, but the dashboard's conceptual clarity is paramount to avoid early user friction.
