The primary concern for validation is the 'Created with 0 elements' wireframe. Without a visual representation of the login screen and, critically, the basic dashboard, a comprehensive validation against the stated rules is impossible. 

Specifically:

1.  **Can a new user predict what happens next?** For the Google login, the pattern is well-established, so predictability is high. However, for the 'basic dashboard page with mock content' post-login, there is no UI to evaluate. It's impossible to determine if a new user can predict what actions are available or what the purpose of the elements will be without any design.

2.  **Is anything explained too late?** Again, the login flow is standard. For the dashboard, without any content or layout defined, we cannot assess if critical information or functionality is introduced prematurely or too late. The belief 'The product must feel obvious without documentation' hinges directly on this, and an empty wireframe leaves this entirely unvalidated.

3.  **Does the UI match the intent?** The product intent is to provide an 'intuitive, fast-feeling product experience for technically competent users' and to feel 'obvious without documentation'. While Shadcn UI provides a solid foundation for aesthetics and performance, the actual *structure and content* of the dashboard UI are what will truly determine if it's intuitive and obvious. With no UI defined, this key validation point cannot be addressed. The lack of a wireframe means there's no concrete UI to match against the intent.

To proceed with meaningful validation, even a high-level wireframe for the dashboard, indicating its primary elements and their arrangement, is essential.
