It only indicates \"One or more pipeline stages failed.\" Without detailed logs from the GitHub Actions run, the root cause cannot be identified, and an automatic fix cannot be implemented.\n\n### Error Type\n\nUnknown (Insufficient Information)\n\n### Fix Applied\n\nNo automatic fix could be applied at this time.\n\n### Files Modified\n\nNone\n\n### Validation\n\nTo proceed with error recovery, please provide the full, detailed logs from the failed GitHub Actions run: [https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21576975471](https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21576975471). Once detailed logs are available, the Error Recovery Agent can re-analyze the failure.\n\n**Action Required:** `needs-human-review`",
