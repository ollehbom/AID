  "issue_update": "## Analysis Complete\n\n### Root Cause\nThe provided error log is too generic and only indicates a general pipeline failure. It lacks specific error messages, tracebacks, file paths, or line numbers required for automated analysis and fix implementation. Manual investigation of the workflow run logs is necessary to identify the root cause.\n\n### Error Type\nEnvironment (General Pipeline Failure - requires further investigation)\n\n### Fix Applied\nNo automated fix could be applied at this stage due to insufficient error details. This issue requires human intervention to review the full workflow logs.\n\n### Files Modified\nNone\n\n### Validation\n**Manual Steps Required:**\n1. Access the workflow run URL: https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21689285658\n2. Navigate to the failed job(s) and step(s).\n3. Review the detailed logs for any specific error messages (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `ModuleNotFoundError`, `FileNotFoundError`) and their corresponding tracebacks, file paths, and line numbers.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nOnce the specific error details are identified, please update this issue with the full error log, and the Error Recovery Agent can be re-triggered for a targeted fix. Tagging with `needs-human-review`.\n",
  "pr_description": "No code changes proposed.\n\nThis PR is a placeholder or an indication that the Error Recovery Agent could not automatically fix the pipeline failure `error-20260204-213811`.\n\n**Reason:** The provided error log was too generic, only indicating a general pipeline failure without specific error messages, tracebacks, or file paths. \n\n**Action Required:** Manual inspection of the workflow run logs at https://github.com/ollehbom/AID/actions/runs/21689285658 is necessary to identify the root cause. Once specific error details are available, the agent can be re-invoked."
